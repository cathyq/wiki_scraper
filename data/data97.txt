The motivating impulse for the ''Times'' to finally run the puzzle (which took over 20 years even though its publisher, [[Arthur Hays Sulzberger]], was a longtime crossword fan) appears to have been the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]]; in a memo dated December 18, 1941, an editor conceded that the puzzle deserved space in the paper, considering what was happening elsewhere in the world and that readers might need something to occupy themselves during blackouts.<ref name=\"Shepard\"/> The puzzle proved popular, and Sulzberger himself would author a ''Times'' puzzle before the year was out.<ref name=\"Shepard\"/> In 1950, the crossword became a daily feature.

A full specification sheet listing the paper's requirements for crossword puzzle submission can be found online (see \"External Links\") or by writing to the paper. Aside from increasing in difficulty throughout the week, the Monday-Thursday puzzles and the Sunday puzzle always have a theme, some sort of connection between at least three long (usually Across) answers, such as a similar type of pun, letter substitution, or alteration in each entry. Another theme type is that of a humorous quotation broken up into symmetrical portions and spread throughout the grid. For example, the February 11, 2004, puzzle by Ethan Friedman featured a theme quotation from Anton Chekhov: ANY IDIOT CAN FACE / A CRISIS IT'S THIS / DAY-TO-DAY LIVING / THAT WEARS YOU OUT.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thumbnails|url=http://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Ethan%20Friedman|publisher=XWordInfo|accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref> Notable dates such as holidays or anniversaries of famous events are often commemorated with an appropriately themed puzzle, although only two are currently commemorated on a routine annual basis: [[Christmas]] and [[April Fool's Day]].<ref name=\"Shortz talk\">[http://ideafestival.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/09/puzzled--will-s.html Account of 2008 presentation by [[Will Shortz]]. Retrieved on 2009-03.13]</ref> The Friday and Saturday puzzles, the most difficult in the paper, are usually unthemed and \"wide open\", with fewer black squares and more long words. The maximum word count for a themed weekday puzzle is normally 78 words, while the maximum for an unthemed Friday or Saturday puzzle is 72; Sunday puzzles must contain 140 words or fewer.<ref name=\"Specification sheet\" /> Given the ''Times's'' reputation as a paper for a literate, well-read, and somewhat arty audience, puzzles frequently reference works of literature, art, or classical music, as well as modern TV, movies, or other touchstones of popular culture.<ref name=\"Specification sheet\"/>\n\nThe puzzle follows a number of conventions, both for tradition's sake and to aid solvers in completing the crossword:\n* Nearly all the ''Times'' crossword grids have [[rotational symmetry]]: they can be rotated 180 degrees and remain identical. Rarely, puzzles with only vertical or horizontal symmetry can be found; yet rarer are asymmetrical puzzles, usually when an unusual theme requires breaking the symmetry rule. This rule has been part of the puzzle since the beginning; when asked why, initial editor Margaret Farrar is said to have responded, \"Because it is prettier.\"<ref name=\"Shepard\"/>\n* Any time a clue contains the tag \"abbr.\" or an [[abbreviation]] more significant than \"e.g.\", the answer will be an abbreviation (e.g., '''M.D. org.''' = '''AMA''').<ref name=\"Shortz, How to Solve\" />\n* Any time a clue ends in a [[question mark]], the answer is a [[play on words]].<ref name=\"Shortz, How to Solve\" />\n* Occasionally, themed puzzles will require certain squares to be filled in with a symbol, multiple letters, or a word, rather than one letter (so-called \"[[rebus]]\" puzzles). This symbol/letters/word will be repeated throughout in each themed entry. For example, the December 6, 2012 puzzle by Jeff Chen featured a rebus theme based on the chemical [[PH|pH scale]] used for acids and bases, which required the letters \"pH\" to be written (together in a single square) in several locations in the puzzle (in the middle of entries such as \"trium'''pH'''\" or \"so'''pH'''ocles\").<ref>{{cite web|last=Amlen|first=Deb|title=Theme of this Puzzle|url=http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/theme-of-this-puzzle/|work=\"Wordplay\" blog|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=26 February 2013|date=5 December 2012}}</ref> \n* [[French language|French]]-, [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-, or [[Latin language|Latin]]-language answers, and more rarely answers from other languages are indicated either by a tag in the clue giving the answer language (e.g., 'Summer: Fr.' = ETE) or by the use in the clue of a word from that language, often a personal or place name(e.g. 'Friends of Pierre' = AMIS or 'The ocean, e.g., in Orleans' = EAU).<ref name=\"Shortz, How to Solve\" />\n* Clues and answers must always match in [[part of speech]], [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical number|number]], and [[Comparison (grammar)|degree]]. Thus a [[plural]] clue always indicates a plural answer (and the same for singular), a clue in the [[past tense]] will always be matched by an answer in the same tense, and a clue containing a [[Comparative syntax in English|comparative]] or [[superlative]] will always be matched by an answer in the same degree.<ref name=\"Shortz, How to Solve\" />\n* The answer word (or any of the answer words, if it consists of multiple words) will never appear in the clue itself. Unlike in some easier puzzles in other outlets, the number of words in the answer is not indicated in the clue itself\u2014so a one-word clue can mean a multiple-word answer.{{cn|date=June 2015}}\n* The theme, if any, will be applied consistently throughout the puzzle. e.g., if one of the theme entries is a particular variety of pun, all the theme entries will be of that type.<ref name=\"Specification sheet\"/>\n* In general, any words that might appear elsewhere in the newspaper, such as well-known brand names, pop culture figures, or current phrases of the moment, are fair game.{{cn|date=June 2015}}\n* No entries involving profanity, sad or disturbing topics, or overly explicit answers should be expected, though some have snuck in. The April 3, 2006 puzzle, contained the word SCUMBAG (a slang term for a condom), which had previously appeared in a Times article, quoting people using the word. Shortz apologized and said the term would not appear again.<ref>New York Times Crossword Forum, 2006-04-04</ref><ref>http://www.slate.com/id/2139453/</ref> The word PENIS also appeared once in a Maleska-edited puzzle, clued as \"The __ mightier than the sword.\"{{cn|date=June 2015}}\n* Spoken phrases are always indicated by enclosure in quotation marks, e.g., \"Get out of here!\" = LEAVE NOW.{{cn|date=June 2015}}\n* Short exclamations are sometimes clued by a phrase in square brackets, e.g., \"[It's cold!]\" = BRR.{{cn|date=June 2015}}\n* When the answer needs an additional word in order to fit the clue, it is indicated with a parenthetical phrase or the use of \"with.\" For example, \"Think (over)\" = MULL, since \"think\" only means \"mull\" when paired with the word \"over\". Similarly, \"Become understood, with in\" = SINK, since \"Sink in\" means \"to become understood.\"{{cn|date=June 2015}}\n* Times style is to always capitalize the first letter of a clue, regardless of whether the clue is a complete sentence or whether the first word is a proper noun. On occasion, this is used to deliberately create difficulties for the solver; e.g., in the clue \"John, for one\" it is ambiguous as to whether the clue is referring to the proper name [[John (given name)|John]] or to the slang term for a bathroom.{{or|date=June 2015}}\n* A good rule of thumb when in doubt of a given clue/answer is to apply the 'substitution test': Create a sentence featuring the clue word(s) and then see if you can substitute the answer and leave the parsing and meaning of the rest of the sentence unchanged. If not, the answer is almost certainly incorrect. For example, if you are unsure of the clue/answer combination \"Approach, perhaps\" = HIT ON, you could try substituting in the sentence \"The shy man jealously watched the smooth talkers effortlessly APPROACH women at the party\" / \"The shy man jealously watched the smooth talkers effortlessly HIT ON women at the party.\" Since the meaning of the sentence remains unchanged, this would be a valid clue/answer combination (although not necessarily the correct one in a given puzzle).{{or|date=June 2015}}\n\n==Variety puzzles==\n\n===Second Sunday puzzles===\nIn addition to the primary crossword, the ''Times'' publishes a second Sunday puzzle each week, of varying types, something that the first crossword editor, Margaret Farrar, saw as a part of the paper's Sunday puzzle offering from the start; she wrote in a memo when the ''Times'' was considering whether or not to start running crosswords that \"The smaller puzzle, which would occupy the lower part of the page, could provide variety each Sunday. It could be topical, humorous, have rhymed definitions or story definitions or quiz definitions. The combination of these two would offer meat and dessert, and catch the fancy of all types of puzzlers.\"<ref name=\"Shepard\"/> Currently, every other week is an [[Acrostic (puzzle)|acrostic]] puzzle authored by Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon, with a rotating selection of other puzzles, including [[Crossword#Diagramless crosswords|diagramless]] crosswords, Puns and Anagrams, [[cryptic crossword|cryptics]] (a.k.a. \"British-style crosswords\"), Split Decisions, Spiral Crosswords, word games, and more rarely, other types (some authored by Shortz himself\u2014the only puzzles he has created for the ''Times'' during his tenure as crossword editor).<ref name=\"New York Times Premium page\"/> Of these types, the acrostic has the longest and most interesting history, beginning on May 9, 1943, authored by Elizabeth S.

Middleton for a period of over 30 years, until August 15, 1999, when the pair of Cox and Rathvon became just the fourth author of the puzzle in its history.<ref name=\"Acrostic history\"/> The name of the puzzle also changed over the years, from \"Double-Crostic\" to \"Kingsley Double-Crostic,\" \"Acrostic Puzzle,\" and finally (since 1991) just \"Acrostic.\"<ref name=\"Acrostic history\"/>\n\n===Other puzzles===\nAs well as publishing a second word puzzle on Sundays, the ''Times'' publishes a [[KenKen]] numbers puzzle (a variant of the popular [[sudoku]] logic puzzles) each day of the week.<ref name=\"New York Times Premium page\" /> The KenKen and second Sunday puzzles are available online at the [http://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/index.html New York Times crosswords and games page], as are \"[[SET!]]\" logic puzzles and a monthly \"bonus\" crossword with a theme relating to the current month.<ref name=\"New York Times Premium page\" />\n\n==Records and puzzles of note==\nFans of the ''Times'' crossword have kept track of a number of records and interesting puzzles (primarily from among those published in Shortz's tenure), including those below.

Perhaps the most famous is the November 5, 1996 puzzle by [[Jeremiah Farrell]], published on the day of the [[United States presidential election, 1996|U.S. presidential election]], which has been featured in the movie ''[[Wordplay (film)|Wordplay]]'' and the book ''The Crossword Obsession'' by Coral Amende, as well as discussed by Peter Jennings on ABC News, featured on CNN, and elsewhere.<ref name=\"Shortz bio\"/><ref name=\"Shortz bio from Indiana U\"/><ref name=\"Amende\">Amende, Coral (1996) ''The Crossword Obsession'', [[Berkley Books]]: New York ISBN 978-0756790868</ref><ref name=\"CNN\">[http://www.crosswordtournament.com/articles/cnn032702.htm Ali Velshi \"Business Unusual: Will Shortz\", CNN]</ref> The two leading candidates that year were [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Bob Dole]]; in Farrell's puzzle one of the long clue/answer combinations read \"Title for 39-Across tomorrow\" = MISTER PRESIDENT. The remarkable feature of the puzzle is that 39-Across could be answered either CLINTON or BOB DOLE, and all the Down clues and answers that crossed it would work either way (e.g., \"Black Halloween animal\" could be either BAT or CAT depending on which answer you filled in at 39-Across; similarly \"French 101 word\" could equal LUI or OUI, etc.).<ref name=\"Amende\"/> Constructors have dubbed this type of puzzle a \"[[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger]] puzzle\" after the famous [[paradox]] of [[Schr\u00f6dinger's cat]], which was both alive and dead at the same time. Since Farrell's invention of it, four other constructors: Patrick Merrell, Ethan Friedman, David J. Kahn, and Joe Krozel have made use of a similar trick.\n\nIn another notable ''Times'' crossword, 27-year-old Bill Gottlieb proposed to his girlfriend, Emily Mindel, via the crossword puzzle of January 7, 1998, written by noted crossword constructor Bob Klahn.<ref name=\"Gottlieb puzzle\">[http://select.nytimes.com/premium/xword/Jan0798.puz January 7, 1998 wedding proposal crossword (subscription required)]</ref><ref name=\"Barron\">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE3DB1130F93BA35752C0A96E958260 [[James Barron (journalist)|James Barron]] \"Two Who Solved the Puzzle of Love\", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1998-01-08.

What made the puzzle notable is that the prior night's episode of the US television show [[Jeopardy!]] featured video clues of Will Shortz for five of the theme answers (all but GARY GYGAX and GENERATION X) which the contestants attempted to answer during the course of the show.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Wordplay (film)]]'', a 2006 documentary about the crossword\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.nytimes.com/ref/crosswords/classicpuz.html Online version of ''New York Times'' Crossword Puzzle (subscription required)]\n* [http://www.cruciverb.com/index.php?action=ezportal;sa=page;p=16 ''New York Times'' crossword specification sheet]\n* [http://xwordinfo.com/ XWordInfo.com, blog featuring statistics on the ''Times'' puzzles]\n* [http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/ The ''Times's'' \"official\" crossword blog, featuring daily commentary and discussion on each day's puzzle]\n* [http://www.magmic.com/nytimes/ Magmic Games ''New York Times'' Crossword Micro-site]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:New York Times crossword puzzle, The}}\n[[Category:Crosswords]]\n[[Category:The New York Times|Crossword]]\n[[Category:1942 introductions]]"
