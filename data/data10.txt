Sullivan''''', [[Case citation|376 U.S. 254]] (1964),<ref name=nytvss>''New York Times v. Sullivan'', [http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/comm/free_speech/nytvsullivan.html United States Supreme Court, March 9, 1964 (376 U.S. 254).]</ref> was a landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case that established the [[actual malice]] standard, which has to be met before press reports about public officials can be considered to be [[defamation]] and [[libel]];<ref>Buescher, John. \"[http://www.teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/23821 The 4th Estate as the 4th Branch].\" [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org], accessed 2 September 2011.</ref> and hence allowed free reporting of the [[civil rights]] campaigns in the southern United States. It is one of the key decisions supporting the [[freedom of the press]]. The actual malice standard requires that the plaintiff in a defamation or libel case prove that the publisher of the statement in question knew that the statement was false or acted in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity. Because of the extremely high burden of proof on the plaintiff, and the difficulty of proving the defendant's knowledge and intentions, such cases\u2014when they involve public figures\u2014rarely prevail.\n\nBefore this decision, there were nearly US $300 million in libel actions outstanding against news organizations from the Southern states, and it had caused many publications to exercise great caution when reporting on [[civil rights]], for fear that they might be held accountable for libel.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} After ''[[The New York Times]]'' prevailed in this case, news organizations were free to report the widespread disorder and civil rights infringements. The ''Times'' maintained that the case against it was brought to intimidate news organizations and prevent them from reporting illegal actions of public employees in the South as they attempted to continue to support [[Racial segregation|segregation]].\n\n==Background of the case==\nOn March 29, 1960, ''[[The New York Times]]'' carried a full-page advertisement titled \"Heed Their Rising Voices\",<ref>[http://research.archives.gov/description/2641477 Heed Their Rising Voices Advertisement, courtesy of the National Archives]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Advertisement \u201cHeed Their Rising Voices,\u201d New York Times, March 29, 1960 (National Archives Identifier 2641477)|url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/documented-rights/exhibit/section4/detail/heed-rising-voices.html|publisher=National Archives-Atlanta, Records of District Courts of the United States|accessdate=11 March 2014}}</ref> which solicited funds to defend [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] against an [[Alabama]] perjury indictment. The advertisement described actions against civil rights protesters, some of them inaccurately, some of which involved the police force of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], Alabama. Discrepancies were generally minor.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  Referring to the Alabama State Police, the advertisement stated: \"They have arrested [King] seven times...\"<ref name=USSC>{{cite web|title=New York Times Co. v. Sullivan|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0376_0254_ZO.html}}</ref> However, at that point he had been arrested four times.<ref name=USSC/> Although African-American students staged a demonstration on the State Capitol steps, they sang the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|National Anthem]] and not ''[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]''.<ref name=USSC/>  Although the Montgomery Public Safety commissioner, L. B. Sullivan, was not named in the advertisement, the inaccurate criticism of actions by the police was considered defamatory to Sullivan as well, due to his duty to supervise the police department.<ref name=USSC/>\n\nAlabama law denied a public officer recovery of punitive damages in a libel action concerning their official conduct unless they first made a written demand for a public retraction and the defendant failed or refused to comply, so Sullivan sent such a request.<ref name=nytvss/> The ''Times'' did not publish a retraction in response to the demand. Instead it wrote a letter{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} stating, among other things, that \"we ... are somewhat puzzled as to how you think the statements in any way reflect on you,\" and \"you might, if you desire, let us know in what respect you claim that the statements in the advertisement reflect on you\".<ref name=nytvss/> Sullivan did not respond but instead filed a libel suit a few days later. He also sued four African American ministers mentioned in the ad, specifically [[Ralph Abernathy]], [[S.S. Seay|S.S. Seay, Sr.]], [[Fred Shuttlesworth]], and [[Joseph Lowery]]. Sullivan won $500,000 in an Alabama court judgment.<ref name=\"oyez.org\">[http://www.oyez.org/cases/1960-1969/1963/1963_39 New York Times v. Sullivan at Oyez.]</ref>\n\nThe ''Times'' did subsequently publish a retraction of the advertisement upon the demand of Governor [[John Malcolm Patterson|John Patterson]] of Alabama, who alleged the publication charged him with \"grave misconduct and ... improper actions and omissions as Governor of Alabama and ''[[ex officio]]'' chairman of the State Board of Education of Alabama.\"<ref name=nytvss/> When asked to explain why there had been a retraction for the Governor but not for Sullivan, the Secretary of the ''Times'' testified: <blockquote>\"We did that because we didn't want anything that was published by the ''Times'' to be a reflection on the State of Alabama and the Governor was, as far as we could see, the embodiment of the State of Alabama and the proper representative of the state and, furthermore, we had by that time learned more of the actual facts which the ad purported to recite and, finally, the ad did refer to the action of the state authorities and the Board of Education presumably of which the Governor is the ''ex officio'' chairman....\"</blockquote> However, the Secretary also testified he did not think that \"any of the language in there referred to Mr. Sullivan.\"<ref name=nytvss/>\n\nLouis M. Loeb, a partner at the firm of Lord Day & Lord served as chief counsel to the Times from 1948 to 1967,<ref>\"Who's Who in America 1978-1979</ref> successfully argued this case before the United States Supreme Court. The court's ruling held that news publications could not be sued for libel by public figures unless the plaintiffs were able to establish actual malice in the false reporting of a news story. The case, which had been brought against the Times by Montgomery, Alabama public safety commissioner L.B. Sullivan, allowed newspapers to report on the widespread chaos and police abuse accompanying the Civil Rights Movement. Loeb later called the libel cases he argued for The New York Times \"the heaviest responsibility I\u2019ve ever had since I began practicing law.\" [1]\n\n==The court's decision==\nThe Court ruled for ''The Times'', 9\u20130.<ref name=\"oyez.org\"/> The rule of law applied by the Alabama courts was found constitutionally deficient for failure to provide safeguards for freedom of speech and of the press, as required by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. The decision further held that even with the proper safeguards, the evidence presented in this case was insufficient to support a judgment for Sullivan. In sum the court ruled that \"the First Amendment protects the publication of all statements, even false ones, about the conduct of public officials except when statements are made with actual malice (with knowledge that they are false or in reckless disregard of their truth or falsity).\"<ref>{{cite web|title=New York Times v. Sullivan|url=http://www.oyez.org/cases/1960-1969/1963/1963_39|work=The Oyez Project at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law|publisher=The Oyez Project at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law|accessdate=11 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Actual malice===\nThe Court held that a public official suing for defamation must prove that the statement in question was made with ''[[actual malice]].'' In this context, the phrase refers to knowledge or reckless lack of investigation, rather than its ordinary meaning of malicious intent. In his concurring opinion, [[Hugo Black|Justice Black]] explained that \"'[m]alice,' even as defined by the Court, is an elusive, abstract concept, hard to prove and hard to disprove. The requirement that malice be proved provides at best an evanescent protection for the right critically to discuss public affairs and certainly does not measure up to the sturdy safeguard embodied in the First Amendment.\"\n\nThe term \"malice\" was not newly invented for the case; it came from existing libel law. In many jurisdictions, including Alabama (where the case arose), proof of \"actual malice\" (actual knowledge of falsity, or reckless disregard for the truth) was required in order for [[punitive damages]] to be awarded, or for other increased penalties.  Since a writer's malicious intent is hard to prove, proof that the writer knowingly published a falsehood was generally accepted as proof of malice, under the assumption that only a person with ill intent would knowingly publish something false. In ''[[Hoeppner v. Dunkirk Printing Co.]]'', 254 N.Y. 95 (1930), similarly, the court said: <blockquote>\"The plaintiff alleges that this criticism of him and of his work was not fair and was not honest; it was published with actual malice, ill will and spite. If he establishes this allegation, he has made out a cause of action. No comment or criticism, otherwise libelous, is fair or just comment on a matter of public interest if it be made through actual ill will and malice.\" (p.&nbsp;106)</blockquote>\n\nIn ''New York Times Co. v. Sullivan'', the Supreme Court adopted the term \"actual malice,\" giving it constitutional significance.\n\n==International comparisons==\nThe rule that somebody alleging defamation should have to prove untruth, rather than that the defendant should have to prove the truth of a statement, stood as a departure from the previous common law. In England, the development was specifically rejected in ''[[Derbyshire County Council v. Times Newspapers Ltd]]''<ref>''Derbyshire County Council v. Times Newspapers Ltd'' [1993] AC 534</ref> and it was also rejected in Canada in ''[[Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto]]''<ref>''[[Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto]]'' [1995] 2 SCR 1130</ref> and more recently in ''[[Grant v. Torstar Corp.]]''.<ref>''[[Grant v. Torstar Corp.]]'' [2009] 2009 SCC 61</ref>  In Australia, the outcome of the case was followed in ''[[Theophanous v Herald & Weekly Times Ltd|Theophanous v. The Herald & Weekly Times Ltd]]'',<ref>''[[Theophanous v Herald & Weekly Times Ltd|Theophanous v. The Herald & Weekly Times Ltd]]'' (1994) 182 CLR 104</ref> but ''Theophanous'' was itself overruled by the High Court of Australia in ''[[Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'' (1997) 189 CLR 520.\n\n==50th anniversary==\nIn 2014, on the 50th anniversary of the ruling, ''The New York Times'' released an editorial in which it stated the background of the case, laid out the rationale for the Supreme Court decision, critically reflected on the state of freedom of the press 50 years after the ruling and compared the state of freedom of the press in the United States with other nations. The editorial board of ''The New York Times'' heralded the ''Sullivan'' decision as \"the clearest and most forceful defense of press freedom in American history\"<ref name=\"NYT20140309\">{{cite news|title=The Uninhibited Press, 50 Years Later|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/opinion/sunday/the-uninhibited-press-50-years-later.html |accessdate=11 March 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=9 March 2014|author=The New York Times Editorial Board|quote=A version of this editorial appeared in print on March 9, 2014, on page SR10 of the New York edition with the headline: The Uninhibited Press, 50 Years Later.}}</ref> and added:\n\n{{quote|The ruling was revolutionary, because the court for the first time rejected virtually any attempt to squelch criticism of public officials\u2014even if false\u2014as antithetical to \u201cthe central meaning of the First Amendment.\u201d Today, our understanding of freedom of the press comes in large part from the Sullivan case. Its core observations and principles remain unchallenged, even as the Internet has turned everyone into a worldwide publisher\u2014capable of calling public officials instantly to account for their actions, and also of ruining reputations with the click of a mouse.<ref name=\"NYT20140309\" />}}\n\n==Later developments==\n*''[[Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts]]'', 388 U.S. 130 (1967) held that public figures who are not public officials may still sue news organizations if they disseminate information about them which is recklessly gathered and unchecked.\n*''[[Gertz v.
