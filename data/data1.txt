A national list was created on April 9, 1942, in ''The New York Times Book Review'' (Sundays) as a supplement to the regular city lists (Monday edition).<ref name=miller/> The national list was ranked according to how many times the book appeared in the city lists.<ref name=miller/> A few years later, the city lists were eliminated entirely leaving only the national ranking list, which was compiled according to \"reports from leading booksellers in 22 cities\".<ref name=miller/> This methodology of ranking by bookseller sales figures remains to this day although the exact data compilation process is a trade secret and has evolved over time.<ref name=diamond/>\n\nBy the 1950s, the ''Times'' list had become the leading best seller list for book professionals to monitor, along with ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''.<ref name=miller/> In the 1960s and 70s, mall-based chain bookstores [[B.

Expanded lists that show additional titles are available online through the Book Review website.  The lists have been subdivided several times. \"Advice, How-To, and Miscellaneous\" debuted as a list of five on January 1, 1984. It was created because advice best-sellers were sometimes crowding the general non-fiction list.<ref>{{cite news|title=TBR: Inside the list|work=The New York Times|date= February 24, 2008| page= BR26}}</ref> Its inaugural number one bestseller, ''The Body Principal'' by [[Victoria Principal]], had been number 10 and number 12 on the non-fiction lists for the two preceding weeks.<ref>{{cite news|title=The New York Times Book Review Best Sellers| work=The New York Times|date= January 1, 1984| page =BR28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Best Sellers|work=The New York Times|date= December 25, 1983| page =BR13}}</ref> In July 2000, the \"Children's Best Sellers\" was created after the [[Harry Potter]] series had stayed in the top spots on the fiction list for an extended period of time.<ref>{{cite web|website=riverdeep.net|url=http://www.riverdeep.net/current/2001/11/111201t_top10.jhtml |title=Bestseller Math|date= November 12, 2001}}</ref> The children's list was printed monthly until Feb. 13, 2011, when it was changed to once an issue (weekly).

In addition a third new list was published on the web only, which tracks combined print sales (hardcover and paperback) in fiction and nonfiction. In December 16, 2012, the children's chapter books list was divided into two new lists: middle-grade (ages 8\u201312) and young adult (age 12\u201318), both which include sales across all platforms (hard, paper and e-book).\n\n==Criticisms==\nThe list has been criticized by authors, publishers, book industry executives, and others for not providing an accurate accounting of true best-seller status.<ref name=miller/> These criticisms have been ongoing ever since the list originated.<ref name=miller/> A book industry report in the 1940s found that best-seller lists were a poor indicator of sales, since they were based on misleading data and were only measuring fast sales (see \"fast sale\" criticism below).<ref name=miller/> A 2004 report quoted a senior book marketing executive who said the rankings were \"smoke and mirrors\"; while a report in ''[[Book History (journal)|Book History]]'' found that many professionals in the book industry \"scoffed at the notion that the lists are accurate\".<ref name=miller/>\n\nSpecific criticisms include:\n\n*Fast sales.<ref name=miller/><ref>J. E. Fishman, [http://www.thenervousbreakdown.com/jefishman/2010/12/12-common-misperceptions-about-book-publishing/ 12 Common Misperceptions About Book Publishing], ''[[The Nervous Breakdown (magazine)|The Nervous Breakdown]]'', December 1, 2010. Retrieved July 27, 2011.</ref> A book that never makes the list can actually outsell books on the best-seller list. This is because the best-seller list reflects sales in a given week, not total sales. Thus, one book may sell heavily in a given week, making the list, while another may sell at a slower pace, never making the list, but selling more copies over time.\n*Double counting. By including wholesalers in the polls along with retail bookstores, books may be double-counted.<ref name=miller/> Wholesalers report how much they sell to retailers, and retailers report how much they sell to customers, thus there can be overlap with the same reported book's being sold twice within a given time frame. In addition, retailers may return books to wholesalers months later if they never sell, thus resulting in a \"sale\"'s being reported that never came to fruition. For example, mass-market paperbacks can see as high as 40% return rates from the retailer back to the wholesaler.<ref name=miller/> \n*Manipulation by authors and publishers.<ref name=miller/> Author [[Jacqueline Susann]] (''[[Valley of the Dolls]]'') attempted to \"butter-up\" ''Times''-reporting booksellers and personally bought large quantities of her own book.<ref name=miller/> Author [[Wayne Dyer]] (''[[Your Erroneous Zones]]'') purchased thousands of copies of his own book.<ref name=miller/> [[Al Neuharth]] (''Confessions of an S. O. B.''), former head of [[Gannett Company]], had his Gannett Foundation buy two thousand copies of his own autobiography.<ref name=miller/> In 1995, authors Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema spent $200,000 to buy ten thousand copies of ''[[The Discipline of Market Leaders]]'' from dozens of bookstores.<ref name=miller/> Although they denied any wrongdoing, the book spent 15 weeks on the list. As a result of this scandal the ''Times'' began placing a dagger symbol next to any title for which bookstores reported bulk orders.<ref name=miller/> However daggers do not always appear; for example [[Tony Hsieh]]'s ''[[Delivering Happiness]]'' was known to have been manipulated with bulk orders but didn't have a dagger.<ref name=bercovici>{{cite web |url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2013/02/22/heres-how-you-buy-your-way-onto-the-new-york-times-bestsellers-list/ |title=Here's How You Buy Your Way Onto The New York Times Bestsellers List |work=Forbes |author=Jeff Bercovici |date=February 22, 2013 |accessdate=March 17, 2014}}</ref> Companies that contract with authors to manipulate the bestseller list through \"bestseller campaigns\" include [[ResultSource]].<ref name=trachtenberg>{{cite web |url=http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323864304578316143623600544 |title=The Mystery of the Book Sales Spike |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |author=Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg |date=February 22, 2013 |accessdate=March 17, 2014}}</ref>\n*Manipulation by retailers and wholesalers.<ref name=miller/> It happens with regularity that wholesalers and retailers deliberately or inadvertently manipulate the sales data they report to the ''Times''.<ref name=miller/> Since being on the ''Times'' best-seller list increases the sales of a book, bookstores and wholesalers may report a book is a best-seller before it actually is one, in order that it might later become a \"legitimate\" best-seller through increased sales due to its inclusion on the best-seller list,<ref name=miller/> leading to the best-seller list's becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy for the booksellers.\n*Leading data collection. The ''Times'' provides booksellers with a form containing a list of books it believes might be bestsellers, to check off, with an alternative \"Other\" column to fill in manually.<ref name=miller/> It's been criticized as a leading technique to create a best-seller list based on books the ''Times'' thinks might be included.<ref name=miller/> One bookseller compared it to a voting card in which two options for President are provided: \"Bill Clinton and Other\".<ref name=miller/><!--See pg. 297, a quote from bookseller-->\n*Self-fulfilling. Once a book makes it onto the list it is heavily marketed as a \"best-seller\", purchased by readers who seek out best-sellers, given preferential treatment by retailers, online and offline, who create special best-seller categories including special in-store placement and price discounts, and is carried by retailers that generally don't carry other books (e.g., supermarkets).<ref name=miller/> Thus, the list can become self-fulfilling in determining which books have high sales and remain on the list.<ref name=miller/>\n*Conflicts of interest. Due to high financial impact of making the list, since the 1970s publishers have created escalator clauses for major authors stipulating that if a book makes the list the author will receive extra money, based on where it ranks and for how long.<ref name=miller/> Authors may also be able to charge higher speaking fees for the status of being a best-seller.<ref name=miller/> As ''[[Book History]]'' said, \"With so much at stake then, it is no wonder that enormous marketing effort goes into getting a book access to this major marketing tool.\"<ref name=miller/>\n\n==Controversies==\nIn 1983, author [[William Peter Blatty]] sued ''The New York Times'' for $6 million, claiming that his latest book, ''[[Legion (Blatty novel)|Legion]]'' (filmed as ''[[The Exorcist III]]''), had not been included in the list due to either negligence or intentional falsehood, saying it should have been included due to high sales.<ref name=miller/> The ''Times'' countered that the list was not mathematically objective but rather was editorial content and thus protected under the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]] as free speech. Blatty appealed it to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case. Thus, the lower court ruling stood that the list is editorial content, not objective factual content, so the ''Times'' had the right to exclude books from the list.<ref name=miller/>\n\nIn 1995, Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema, the authors of  a book called ''[[The Discipline of Market Leaders]]'', colluded to manipulate their book onto the best seller charts. The authors allegedly purchased over 10,000 copies of their own book in small and strategically placed orders at bookstores whose sales are reported to [[Nielsen BookScan|Bookscan]]. Because of the benefits of making ''The New York Times'' Best Seller list (speaking engagements, more book deals, and consulting) the authors felt that buying their own work was an investment that would pay for itself. The book climbed to No. 4 on the list where it sat for 15 weeks; it also peaked at No. 1 on the ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' best seller list. Since such lists hold the power of [[information cascade|cumulative advantage]], chart success often begets more chart success. Although such efforts are not illegal, publishers consider them unethical.<ref>{{cite web\n   |url        = http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1995/b343648.arc.htm\n   |title      = Did Dirty Tricks Create a Best-Seller?\n   |publisher  = Stern, Willy\n   |date=August 1995\n   |accessdate = 2008-02-28\n    }}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, [[Amazon.com]] announced a  50 percent decrease in price for books on the Best Seller List to beat its competition, Barnes & Noble.<ref>[http://www.salon.com/tech/col/rose/1999/06/23/times_bestsellers/index.html Who owns the New York Times bestseller list? ], by Scott Rosenberg, Salon.com, June 23, 1999</ref> After a legal dispute between Amazon and ''The New York Times'', Amazon was permitted to keep using the list on condition that it displayed it in alphabetical rather than numerical order.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55388629.html Amazon.com and The New York Times Settle Legal Dispute Over Use of Times Best Sellers List], ''Business Wire'', August 9, 1999.</ref> Since 2010 (or earlier), this is no longer the case; Amazon now displays the best-seller list in order of best selling titles first.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/239332 New York Times Bestseller list] at [[Amazon.com]].</ref>\n\nIn 2013, ''[[Forbes]]'' published a story titled \"Here's How You Buy Your Way Onto ''The New York Times'' Bestsellers List.\" <ref name=Bercovici2013>{{cite web |url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2013/02/22/heres-how-you-buy-your-way-onto-the-new-york-times-bestsellers-list/|title=Here's How You Buy Your Way Onto The New York Times Bestsellers List  |work=[[Forbes]] |author=Jeff Bercovici |date=February 22, 2013 |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref> The article discusses how ResultSource, a San Diego-based marketing consultancy, specializes in ensuring books make a bestseller list, even guaranteeing a No. 1 spot for those willing to pay enough.
