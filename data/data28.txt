This is a deviation from AP style. \n*''The Times''{{'}}s manual gives rationale for many practices for which ''The AP Stylebook'' does not.\n*''The Times''{{'}}s guide is self-indexed, while the Associated Press's book has separate sections for sports and weather entries, and it combines many entries under such terms as \"weapons\" and \"weather.\"\n*''The Times''{{'}}s book has some whimsical entries, such as one for how to spell ''shh''.\n*''The Times''{{'}}s book requires that the surnames of subjects (sports-related articles being the most notable exceptions) be prefixed with a courtesy title (such as Dr., Mr., Ms., or Mrs.).\n\nThe style guides of [[Dow Jones & Company]] and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' are similar to ''The Times''{{'}}s counterpart (''WSJ'' also adheres to the AP style manual), but they have those differences given above.\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:New York Times Manual of Style and Usage}}\n[[Category:1999 books]]\n[[Category:The New York Times|Manual of Style and Usage]]\n[[Category:Style guides for American English]]\n[[Category:Journalism standards]]\n\n\n{{journalism-book-stub}}\n{{lang-book-stub}}"
