Munsey sold the ''Herald'' newspapers in 1924 to the ''[[New York Tribune]]'', and the ''Paris Herald'' became the ''Paris Herald Tribune'' while the New York paper became ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]''.\n\nThe newspaper became a mainstay of American [[expatriate]] culture in Europe. In [[Ernest Hemingway]]\u2019s 1926 novel ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'', the first thing the novel\u2019s protagonist Jake Barnes does on returning from Spain to France is to buy the ''New York Herald'' from a kiosk in [[Bayonne]] and read it at a cafe.<ref name=reborn>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/end-of-an-era-as-venerable-herald-tribune-to-be-reborn-as-international-new-york-times-1.1558077|title=End of an era as venerable \u2018Herald Tribune\u2019 to be reborn as \u2018International New York Times\u2019|work=[[Irish Times]]|date=12 October 2013}}</ref> In [[Jean-Luc Godard]]\u2019s 1960 film ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'', the female lead character Patricia (played by [[Jean Seberg]]) is an American student journalist who sells the ''New York Herald Tribune'' on the streets of Paris.<ref name=reborn/> Pages from the day\u2019s paper can be seen tacked up through the office windows, a tradition that was to continue with the ''International Herald Tribune''.\n\nIn 1959 [[John Hay Whitney]], a businessman and [[U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom|United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom]], bought the ''New York Herald Tribune'' and its European edition. In 1966 the ''New York Herald Tribune'' was merged into the short-lived ''[[New York World Journal Tribune]]'' and ceased publication, but the Whitney family kept the Paris paper going through partnerships. In December 1966 ''[[The Washington Post]]'' became a joint owner.\n\n''The New York Times'' became a joint owner of the ''Paris Herald Tribune'' in May 1967, whereupon the newspaper became known as the ''International Herald Tribune'' (IHT).<ref name=iht/>\n\nIn 1974, IHT began transmitting facsimile pages of the paper between nations and opened a printing site near London. In 1977 the paper opened a second site in [[Z\u00fcrich]].\n\nIHT began transmitting electronic images of newspaper pages from Paris to Hong Kong via satellite in 1980, making the paper simultaneously available on opposite sides of the planet. This was the first such intercontinental transmission of an English-language daily newspaper and followed the pioneering efforts of the Chinese-language newspaper ''[[Sing Tao Daily]] (\u661f\u5cf6\u65e5\u5831)''.\n\nIn 1991, ''The Washington Post'' and ''The New York Times'' became sole and equal shareholders of IHT. In February 2005 it opened its Asia newsroom in Hong Kong.\n\nIn April 2001, the Japanese newspaper ''[[Asahi Shimbun]] (\u671d\u65e5\u65b0\u805e)'' tied up with IHT and published an English-language newspaper, the '''''International Herald Tribune'''/'''Asahi Shimbun'''''.<ref name \"Utau-hakodake\">[[The Diplomat]] TOKYO NOTES (December 7, 2010).

The takeover ended a 35-year partnership between the two domestic competitors. The ''Post'' was forced to sell when the ''Times'' threatened to pull out and start a competing paper.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} As a result, the ''Post'' entered into an agreement to publish selected articles in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]\u2019s'' European edition. After the takeover the newspaper was subtitled \u201cThe Global Edition of the New York Times\u201d.\n\nIn 2008, the NYT Company announced the merger of the ''New York Times'' and ''IHT'' websites. In March 2009 the ''IHT'' website became the global version of NYTimes.com. In 2013, the New York Times Company announced that the newspaper itself would be renamed ''The International New York Times'' to reflect the company\u2019s focus on its core ''New York Times'' newspaper and to build its international presence.<ref name=namechange /> On 14 October 2013 the ''International Herald Tribune'' appeared on newsstands for the last time. It came with a supplemental section, titled ''Turning the Page I'',  a retrospective on the ''Herald Tribune''\u2019s past articles, photographs and place in newspaper history.
