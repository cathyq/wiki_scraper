"This is a list of adult [[fiction]] books that topped '''[[List of The New York Times Fiction Best Sellers|''The New York Times'' Fiction Best Seller list]] in 1963'''. The list is notable for being blank for part of the winter as the ''New York Times'', like many other newspapers in the city, worked its way through a [[1962\u201363 New York City newspaper strike|major newspaper strike]]. When the strike ended in March, the political thriller ''Seven Days in May '' led the list, having also been at the top at the start of the strike in December 1962. It lasted there only one week before being overtaken by J.D. Salinger's second No. 1 bestseller in 18 months, the anthologized novellas, \"Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters\" and \"Seymour: An Introduction\". \n\nSalinger's book led the list for 14 weeks through the spring of 1963. Daphne du Maurier's ''The Glass-Blowers'' then spent six weeks on the list, followed by Morris West's novel about the Vatican, ''The Shoes of the Fisherman'' (14 weeks). On October 6, ''Shoes'' gave way to  Mary McCarthy's [[Autobiographical novel|semi-autobiographical novel]] The Group, which would spend the next 20 weeks at the top, closing out the year.<ref>[[John Bear]], ''The #1 New York Times Best Seller: intriguing facts about the 484 books that have been #1 New York Times bestsellers since the first list, 50 years ago'', Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1992. pp. 85-89</ref> \n[[Image:Seymoreintroduction.jpg|thumb|Two of J.D.
