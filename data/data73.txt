Formed in 1903 by the merger of several local and regional locals of [[teamster]]s, the union now represents a diverse membership of [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] and [[white-collar worker|professional]] workers in both the [[public sector|public]] and [[private sector]]s. The union had approximately 1.3 million members in 2013.<ref name=\"OLMS_LM-2_2015-03-30\"/> Formerly known as the '''International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America''', the IBT is a member of the [[Change to Win Federation]] and [[Canadian Labour Congress]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Cornelius Shea.png|thumb|[[Cornelius Shea]], first General President of the Teamsters, circa 1905]]\nThe [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) had helped form local unions of teamsters since 1887. In November 1898, the AFL organized the Team Drivers' International Union (TDIU).<ref name=\"Sloane\">Sloane, ''Hoffa,'' 1991.</ref><ref name=\"Taft\">Taft, ''The A.F. of L. in the Time of Gompers,'' 1957.</ref> In 1901, a group of Teamsters in [[Chicago, Illinois]], broke from the TDIU and formed the Teamsters National Union.<ref name=\"Sloane\" /> Unlike the TDIU, which permitted large employers to be members, the new Teamsters National Union permitted only employees, teamster helpers, and owner-operators owning only a single team to join, and advocated higher wages and shorter hours more aggressively than the TDIU.<ref name=\"Sloane\" /> Claiming more than 28,000 members in 47 locals, its president, [[Albert Young (labor leader)|Albert Young]], applied for membership in the AFL. The AFL asked the TDIU to merge with Young's union to form a new, AFL-affiliated union and the two groups did so in 1903, forming the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT),<ref name=\"Taft\" /> and electing [[Cornelius Shea]] as the new union's first president.<ref name=\"Sloane\" /><ref name=\"Taft\" /> The election process proved tumultuous. Shea effectively controlled the convention because the Chicago locals\u2014representing nearly half the IBT's membership<ref name=\"Montgomery\">\nMontgomery, ''The Fall of the House of Labor: The Workplace, the State, and American Labor Activism, 1865-1925,'' 1987.\n</ref>\u2014supported for his candidacy ''en bloc''. Shea was opposed by John Sheridan, president of the Ice Drivers' Union of Chicago. Sheridan and [[George Innes (labor leader)|George Innes]], president of the TDIU, accused Shea of embezzlement in an attempt to prevent his election.<ref>\nSheridan and Innes alleged that Shea had billed locals in Massachusetts $9.61 for services while charging the national union $19.44 for the same services. \"Drivers Bolt Meeting,\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' August 9, 1903.</ref> Shea won the election on August 8, 1903, by a vote of 605 to 480.

In November 1903, Teamsters employed by the [[Chicago City Railway]] went out on strike. Shea attempted to stop sympathy strikes by other Teamster locals, but three locals walked out and eventually disaffiliated over the sympathy-strike issue.<ref>\n\"Teamsters Are For War,\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' November 23, 1903; \"Teamsters Split Over Contracts,\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' November 25, 1903; \"Labor's Leader Made to Dance,\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' December 18, 1903.</ref> A sympathy strike in support of 18,000 striking meat cutters in Chicago in July 1904 led to riots before the extensive use of [[strikebreaker]]s led Shea to force his members back to work (leading to the collapse of the meat cutters' strike).<ref name=\"Fitch\" /><ref>\nBarrett, ''Work and Community in the Jungle: Chicago's Packing-House Workers, 1894-1922,'' 1990; Halpern, ''Down on the Killing Floor: Black and White Workers in Chicago's Packinghouses, 1904-54,'' 1997; \"Strike Spreads,\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' July 27, 1904; \"Riots In Streets After Nightfall Involve Drivers,\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' August 10, 1904; \"Mob of 4,000 Men Charges Police,\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' August 19, 1904; \"Meet in Secret to End Strike,\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' August 14, 1904; \"Meat Supply in Drivers' Power,\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' September 2, 1904.\n</ref><ref name=\"RiseSpread\">\n\"Shea, Head of the Teamsters, Has Risen From A Tip-Cart Man,\" ''Boston Daily Globe,'' December 2, 1906; \"Strike Spreads Among Drivers,\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' August 9, 1904.\n</ref> In the midst of the strife in 1904, the Teamsters convention in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] re-elected Shea by acclamation on August 8, 1904.<ref name=\"RiseSpread\" /> Under his leadership, the union had expanded to nearly  50,000 members in 821 locals in 300 cities, making the Teamsters one of the largest unions in the United States.<ref name=\"Fitch\" />\n\nIn 1905 [[1905 Chicago Teamsters' strike|10,000 Teamsters struck]] in support of [[Lockout (industry)|locked-out]] tailors at [[Montgomery Ward]], and eventually more than 25,000 Teamsters manned the picket lines.<ref name=\"Cohen\">Cohen, ''The Racketeer's Progress: Chicago and the Struggle for the Modern American Economy,'' 1900-1940, 2004.\n</ref><ref name=\"BigStrike\">\n\"Gigantic Strike Is In Full Swing,\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' April 28, 1905; \"Big Strike Has Small Beginning,\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' May 20, 1905; \"To Test Union Sympathy,\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' April 6, 1905.\n</ref><ref name=\"History\">\n\"History of Great Teamsters' Strike Filled with Sensational Incidents,\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' July 21, 1905.\n</ref>\nBut when local newspapers discovered that Shea was living in a local brothel, kept a 19-year-old waitress as a mistress, and had spent the strike hosting parties, public support for the strike collapsed and the strike ended on August 1, 1905.<ref name=\"Cohen\" /><ref name=\"History\" /><ref>\n\"Women Betray Labor Leaders,\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' June 12, 1905.\n</ref><ref name=\"WitwerCorruption\">\nWitwer, ''Corruption and Reform in the Teamsters Union,'' 2003.\n</ref> Despite the revelations, Shea won re-election on August 12, 1905, by a vote of 129 to 121.<ref>\n\"Teamsters Re-Elect Shea,\" ''New York Times,'' August 13, 1905.</ref>\n\nShea was re-elected again in 1905 and 1906, although significant challenges to his presidency occurred each time.<ref>\"Fight to Defeat Teamster Chief,\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' July 7, 1906; \"Teamsters Re-Elect Shea,\" ''New York Times,'' August 10, 1906.\n</ref> Shea's first trial on charges stemming from the 1905 Montgomery Ward strike ended in a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]].<ref>\"Jury In Deadlock In the Shea Case,\" ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' January 20, 1907.\n</ref> However, during the 1906 re-election Shea had promised that he would resign the presidency once his trial had ended.<ref name=\"Scepter\">\"Shea's Scepter About to Fall?\", ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' March 22, 1907.\n</ref> But he did not, and most union members withdrew their support for him.<ref name=\"Scepter\" /> [[Daniel J.

Although he faced opposition in his re-election races in 1908, 1909 and 1910, he never faced opposition again until his retirement in 1952.<ref name=\"Foner1\">Foner, ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States: The Policies and Practices of the American Federation of Labor, 1900-1909,'' 1964.</ref>\n\nThe Teamsters began to expand dramatically and mature organizationally under Tobin. He pushed for the development of \"joint councils\" to which all local unions were forced to affiliate.  Varying in geographical and industrial jurisdiction, the joint councils became important incubators for up-and-coming leadership and negotiating master agreements which covered all employers in a given industry. Tobin also actively discouraged strikes in order to bring discipline to the union and encourage employers to sign contracts, and founded and edited the union magazine, the ''International Teamster.''<ref name=\"Obit\" /><ref name=\"Galenson\" /><ref name=\"Bernstein1\" /><ref name=\"Fink\">Fink, ''Biographical Dictionary of American Labor,'' 1984.</ref><ref name=\"Phelan\">Phelan, ''William Green: Biography of a Labor Leader,'' 1989.</ref> Under Tobin, the Teamsters also first developed the \"regional conference\" system (developed by [[Dave Beck]] in [[Seattle]]), which provided stability, organizing strength, and leadership to the international union.<ref name=\"Galenson\" />\n\nTobin undertook long [[jurisdiction]]al battles with many unions during this period. Fierce disputes occurred between the Teamsters and the Gasoline State Operators' National Council (an AFL [[Directly Affiliated Local Union|federal union]] of gas station attendants), the [[International Longshoremen's Association]], the [[Retail Clerks International Union]], and the [[Transportation Communications International Union|Brotherhood of Railway Clerks]].<ref name=\"Galenson\" /><ref name=\"Bernstein2\">Bernstein, ''The Turbulent Years: A History of the American Worker, 1933-1941,'' 1970.</ref> The most significant disagreement, however, was with the [[International Union of United Brewery, Flour, Cereal, Soft Drink and Distillery Workers|United Brewery Workers]] over the right to represent beer wagon drivers. While the Teamsters lost this battle in 1913, when the AFL awarded jurisdiction to the Brewers, they won when the issue came before the AFL Executive Board again in 1933, when the Brewers were still recovering from their near-elimination during [[Prohibition]].<ref name=\"Galenson\" /><ref name=\"Foner1\" /><ref name=\"Taft2\">Taft, ''The A.F. of L. From the Death of Gompers to the Merger,'' 1959.</ref><ref>\"Craft Unionists Win in Federation,\" ''New York Times,'' October 11, 1933.</ref> The raids and new member organizing in the 1930s led to significant membership increases. Teamster membership stood at just 82,000 in 1932.  Tobin took advantage of the wave of pro-union sentiment engendered by the passage of the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]], and by 1935 union membership had increased nearly 65 percent to 135,000. By 1941, Tobin had a dues-paying membership of 530,000\u2014making the Teamsters the fastest-growing labor union in the United States.<ref name=\"Galenson\" />\n\nOne of the most significant events in union history occurred in 1934.  A group of radicals in Local 574 in [[Minneapolis]]\u2014led by [[Farrell Dobbs]], [[Carl Skoglund]], and the Dunne brothers (Ray, Miles and Grant), all members of the [[Trotskyism|Trotskyite]] [[Communist League of America]]\u2014began successfully organizing coal truck drivers in the winter of 1933.<ref name=\"Korth\">Korth, ''Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934,'' 1995.</ref> Tobin, an ardent anti-communist,<ref>Dubofsky and Van Tine, ''John L. Lewis: A Biography,'' 1992.</ref> opposed their efforts and refused to support their 1933 strike.<ref name=\"Korth\" /> Local 574 struck again in 1934, leading to several riots over a nine-day period in May.<ref name=\"Korth\" /> When the employers' association reneged on the agreement, Local 574 resumed the strike, although it ended again after nine days when [[martial law]] was declared by [[Governor of Minnesota|Governor]] [[Floyd B. Olson]].<ref name=\"Korth\" /> Although Local 574 won a contract recognizing the union and which broke the back of the anti-union Citizens Alliance in Minneapolis, Tobin expelled Local 574 from the Teamsters. Member outrage was extensive, and in August 1936 he was forced to recharter the local as 544.<ref name=\"Galenson\" /><ref name=\"Bernstein2\" /><ref name=\"Korth\" /><ref name=\"Schlesinger\">Schlesinger, ''The Age of Roosevelt: The Coming of the New Deal, 1933-1935,'' 1959.</ref> Within a year the newly formed Local 544 had organized 250,000 truckers in the Midwest and formed the Central Conference of Teamsters.<ref name=\"Galenson\" /><ref name=\"Bernstein2\" /><ref name=\"Korth\" /><ref name=\"Schlesinger\" />\n\nExtensive organizing also occurred in the [[West Coast of the United States|West]]. [[Harry Bridges]], radical leader of the [[International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union]] (ILWU), was leading \"the march inland\"\u2014an attempt to organize warehouse workers away from shipping ports.<ref name=\"Galenson\" /><ref>Nelson, ''Workers on the Waterfront: Seamen, Longshoremen and Unionism in the 1930s,'' 1988.</ref> Alarmed by Bridges' radical politics and worried that the ILWU would encroach on Teamster jurisdictions, Dave Beck formed a large regional organization (the Western Conference of Teamsters) to engage in fierce organizing battles and membership raids against the ILWU which led to the establishment of many new locals and the organization of tens of thousands of new members.<ref name=\"Galenson\" /><ref>Garnel, ''The Rise of Teamster Power in the West,'' 1972.</ref>\n\nBut corruption became even more widespread in the Teamsters during the Tobin administration. By 1941, the union was considered the most corrupt in the United States, and the most abusive towards its own members. Tobin vigorously defended the union against such accusations, but also instituted many constitutional and organizational changes and practices which made it easier for union officials to engage in criminal offenses.<ref>Galenson claims that Tobin's \"personal honesty was never challenged...\" See: Galenson, ''The CIO Challenge to the AFL: A History of the American Labor Movement,'' 1960, p. 471. Other historians challenge this conclusion, but conclude any misdeeds Tobin engaged in are minor compared to those of some Teamsters leaders. See: Garnel, ''The Rise of Teamster Power in the West,'' 1972; Witwer, ''Corruption and Reform in the Teamsters Union,'' 2003; Phelan, ''William Green: Biography of a Labor Leader,'' 1989.</ref>\n\n===World War II and the post-war period===\nBy the beginning of [[World War II]], the Teamsters was one of the most powerful unions in the country, and Teamster leaders influential in the corridors of power.  Union membership had risen more than 390 percent between 1935 and 1941 to 530,000.<ref name=\"Galenson\" /> In June 1940, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] appointed IBT President [[Daniel J. Tobin]] to be the official White House liaison to organized labor, and later that year chair of the Labor Division of the Democratic National Committee.<ref name=\"Galenson\" /><ref>Stark, \"White House Link to Conciliate A.F.L.,\" ''New York Times,'' June 11, 1940; \"Tobin, to Aid Flynn, Quits White House,\" ''New York Times,'' August 27, 1940.</ref> In 1942, President Roosevelt appointed Tobin special representative to the [[United Kingdom]] and charged him with investigating the state of the labor movement there.<ref>\"English Labor in War Described By Tobin,\" ''New York Times,'' September 27, 1942.</ref> Tobin was considered three times for Secretary of Labor, and twice refused the post\u2014in 1943 and 1947.<ref>Stark, \"Successor Sought for Miss Perkins,\" ''New York Times,'' December 11, 1944; \"Tobin Endorsed for Labor Post,\" ''New York Times,'' January 18, 1945; Hulen, \"Successors Named,\" ''New York Times,'' May 24, 1945; \"Dan Tobin Refused 2 Cabinet Offers,\" ''New York Times,'' August 12, 1948.</ref> On September 23, 1944, Roosevelt gave his famous \"[[Fala speech]]\" while campaigning in the 1944 presidential election. Because of Roosevelt's strong relationship with Tobin and the union's large membership, the President delivered his speech before the Teamster convention.<ref name=\"Galenson\" />\n\nNonetheless, Teamsters members were restive. Dissident members of the union accused the leadership of suppressing democracy in the union, a charge President Tobin angrily denied.<ref>Stark, \"Dictatorship Issue Stirs Teamsters,\" ''New York Times,'' September 14, 1940.</ref> Over the next year, Tobin cracked down on dissidents and trusted several large locals led by his political opponents.<ref>\"Teamsters Order 2d Ouster in Jersey,\" ''Associated Press,'' March 12, 1941; \"Seceding Drivers Face Union Strife,\" ''New York Times,'' June 11, 1941.</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], The Teamsters strongly endorsed the American labor movement's no-strike pledge. The Teamsters agreed to cease raiding other unions and not strike for the duration of the national emergency. President Tobin even ordered Teamsters members to cross picket lines put up by other unions. Nevertheless, the national leadership sanctioned strikes by Midwestern truckers in August 1942, Southern truckers in October 1943, and brewery workers and milk delivery drivers in January 1945.<ref name=\"Phelan\" /><ref>\"President Summons 'Labor War Board',\" ''New York Times,'' February 5, 1942; \"President Meets Joint Labor Group,\" ''New York Times,'' February 7, 1942; \"WLB Demands End of Trucking Strike,\" ''New York Times,'' August 25, 1942; \"Tobin Demands Unions Punish Strikers,\" ''New York Times,'' March 6, 1943; \"Tobin Bids Public Insist Work Go On,\" ''New York Times,'' June 7, 1943; \"Truck Tie-Up Halts Freight in South,\" ''Associated Press,'' October 11, 1943; \"3 Breweries Face Seizure In Strike,\" ''New York Times,'' January 14, 1945; \"Deliveries Halted on Certified Milk,\" ''New York Times,'' January 15, 1945; \"Tobin Tells Union to Ignore Pickets,\" ''Associated Press,'' May 31, 1945.</ref> The Teamsters did not, however, participate in the great post-war wave of labor strikes.  In the two years following the cessation of hostilities, the Teamsters struck only three times: 10,000 truckers in New Jersey struck for two weeks; workers at [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] struck nationwide for three weeks; and workers at [[Railway Express Agency]] struck for almost a month.<ref>Raskin, \"Union Vote Today,\" ''New York Times,'' September 12, 1946; Raskin, \"Situation Is Eased,\" ''New York Times,'' September 13, 1946; Lissner, \"Tobin Bids Union End Parcel Strike,\" ''New York Times,'' September 19, 1946; Raskin, \"Express Strikers Picket Airfield,\" ''New York Times,'' October 10, 1947; \"Union Head Scores Express Walkout,\" ''New York Times,'' October 13, 1947; \"Tobin Warns Union On Wage Demands,\" ''New York Times,'' June 4, 1948.</ref>\n\nTeamsters leaders strongly opposed enactment of the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] and repeatedly called for its repeal. President Tobin, however, was one of the first labor leaders to sign the non-communist affidavit required by the law.<ref>Signing the affidavit provided the Teamsters with the protection of the NLRA, which was an important tool in the Teamsters' fight with the Brewery Workers. \"Tobin Opposes Law On Labor Disputes,\" ''New York Times,'' January 19, 1947; \"Tobin Signs Affidavit,\" ''New York Times,'' September 16, 1947; Davies, \"Tobin Again Heads Teamsters' Union,\" ''New York Times,'' August 16, 1947.</ref>\n\nThe great wave of organizing which the union engaged in during the Great Depression and the war significantly boosted the political power of a number of regional Teamsters leaders, and the leadership of the union engaged in a number of power struggles in the post-war period.

He announced a raid on the [[International Association of Machinists]] local at [[Boeing]]. Although President Dan Tobin publicly repudiated Beck's actions, Beck had more than enough support from Hoffa and other members of the executive board to force Tobin to back down.<ref>The NLRB subsequently held an election to determine who should represent the workers at Boeing.

Another was the [[International Longshoremen's Association]] (ILA), which represented [[stevedore]]s in most [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] ports. The Teamsters had long desired to bring all shipping and transportation workers into the union, so that no product could be moved anywhere in the U.S. without it being touched by Teamsters hands.  As the ILA came under increasing attack for permitting corruption in its locals, President Beck sought to bring the ILA into the Teamsters.<ref>Raskin, \"Dock Local Bolts to A.F.L.

Hoffa used the grievance procedures of the agreement, which authorized selective strikes against particular employers, to police the agreement or, if Hoffa thought that it served the union's interest, to drive marginal employers out of the industry. The union won substantial gains for its members, fostering a nostalgic image of the Hoffa era as the golden age for Teamster drivers. Hoffa also succeeded where Tobin had failed, concentrating power at the international level, dominating the conferences which Beck and Dobbs had helped build.\n\nIn addition, Hoffa was instrumental in using the assets of the Teamsters' [[pension fund|pension plans]], particularly the Central States plan, to support Mafia projects, such as the development of Las Vegas in the 1950s and 1960s. Pension funds were loaned to finance Las Vegas casinos such as the [[Stardust Resort & Casino]], the [[Fremont Hotel & Casino]], the [[Desert Inn]], the [[Dunes (hotel and casino)]] (which was controlled by Hoffa's attorney, [[Morris Shenker]]), the [[Four Queens]], the [[Aladdin Hotel & Casino]], [[Circus Circus Las Vegas|Circus Circus]], and [[Caesars Palace]].  The pension fund also made a number of loans to associates and relatives of high-ranking Teamster officials.  A close associate of Hoffa during this period was [[Allen Dorfman]].  Dorfman owned an insurance agency that provided insurance claims processing to the Teamsters' union, and which was the subject of an investigation by the [[McClellan Committee]].  Dorfman also had increasing influence over loans made by the Teamsters' pension fund, and after Hoffa went to prison in 1967, Dorfman had primary control over the fund.  Dorfman was murdered in January 1983, shortly after his conviction, along with Teamsters' president [[Roy Lee Williams]], in a bribery case.<ref>The Teamsters by Steven Brill; 1978 Simon and Schuster; New York, New York ISBN 0-671-22771-8</ref>\n\nHoffa was, moreover, defiantly unwilling to reform the union or limit his own power in response to the attacks from [[Robert F. Kennedy]], formerly chief counsel to the McClellan Committee, then [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]]. Kennedy's [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] tried to convict Hoffa for a variety of offenses over the 1960s, finally succeeding on a witness tampering charge in 1964, with key testimony provided by Teamsters business agent [[Edward Grady Partin]] of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], [[Louisiana]]. After exhausting his appeals, Hoffa entered prison in 1967.\n\nHoffa installed [[Frank Fitzsimmons]], an associate from his days in Local 299 in Detroit, to hold his place for him while he served time. Fitzsimmons, however, began to enjoy the exercise of power in Hoffa's absence; in addition, the organized crime figures around him found that he was more pliant than Hoffa had been. While President [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon's]] pardon barred Hoffa from resuming any role in the Teamsters until 1980, Hoffa challenged the legality of that condition and planned to run again for presidency of the union, but disappeared in 1975 under mysterious circumstances.  He is presumed dead, although his body has never been found.\n\n===Decentralization, deregulation and drift===\nUnder General President Frank Fitzsimmons, authority within the Teamsters was decentralized back into the hands of regional, joint council, and local leaders.  While this helped solidify Fitzsimmons' own political position in the union, it also made it more difficult for the union to act decisively on policy issues.  Fitzsimmons also moved the union's political stands slowly to the [[left-wing politics|left]], supporting universal health care, an immediate end to the [[Vietnam War]], urban renewal, and [[Community Unionism|community organizing]]. In 1968, Fitzsimmons and [[United Auto Workers]] President [[Walter Reuther]] formed the [[Alliance for Labor Action]], a new [[national trade union center]] which competed with the AFL-CIO.  The Alliance dissolved in 1972 after Reuther's death.  While the Teamsters won rich national master contracts in trucking and package delivery in the 1970s, it did little to adapt to the changes occurring in the transportation industry.\n\nA major jurisdictional battle with the [[United Farm Workers]] (UFW) broke out in 1970, and did not end until 1977. The Teamsters and UFW had both claimed jurisdiction over farm workers for many years, and in 1967 had signed an agreement settling their differences. But decentralization of power within the union led several Teamster leaders in California to repudiate this agreement without Fitzsimmons' permission and organize large numbers of field workers. His hand forced, Fitzsimmons ordered Teamsters contract negotiators to re-open the handful of contracts it had signed with California growers.<ref>According to the Teamsters, but disputed by UFW, these contracts had purposefully low wages and benefits so as not to make the UFW contracts look bad. See: \"Teamsters End a Truce With Chavez's United Farm Workers.\" ''New York Times.'' December 15, 1972.</ref> The UFW sued, the AFL-CIO condemned the action, and many employers negotiated contracts with the Teamsters rather than with the UFW.<ref>Turner, Wallace. \"Teamsters Sued by Chavez's Union.\" ''New York Times.''

March 11, 1977.</ref>\n\nIn October 1973, Fitzsimmons ended the long-running jurisdictional dispute with the [[International Union of United Brewery, Flour, Cereal, Soft Drink and Distillery Workers|United Brewery Workers]], and the Brewery Workers merged with the Teamsters.<ref>\"Brewery Workers Merger With Teamsters Is Backed.\" ''New York Times.'' October 24, 1973.</ref>\n\nIn 1979 Congress passed legislation that deregulated the freight industry, removing the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]]'s power to impose detailed regulatory tariffs on interstate carriers. The union tried to fight deregulation by attempting to bribe Senator [[Howard Cannon]] of [[Nevada]]. That attempt not only failed, but resulted in the conviction in 1982 of [[Roy Lee Williams|Roy Williams]], the General President who had succeeded Fitzsimmons in 1981. Williams subsequently resigned in 1983 as a condition of remaining free on bail while his appeal proceeded.\n\nDeregulation had catastrophic effects on the Teamsters, opening up the industry to competition from non-union companies who sought to cut costs by avoiding unionization and curbing wages.  Nearly 200 unionized carriers went out of business in the first few years of deregulation, leaving thirty percent of Teamsters in the freight division unemployed. The remaining unionized carriers demanded concessions in wages, work rules, and hours.\n\nWilliams' successor, [[Jackie Presser]], was prepared to grant most of these concessions in the form of a special freight \"relief rider\" that would cut wages by up to 35 percent and establish two-tier wages. [[Teamsters for a Democratic Union]], which had grown out of efforts to reject the 1976 freight agreement, launched a successful national campaign to defeat the relief rider, which was defeated by a vote of 94,086 to 13,082.\n\nThe pressure on the freight industry and the national freight agreement continued, however.  By the end of the 1990s the National Master Freight Agreement, which had covered 500,000 drivers in the late 1970s, dropped to fewer than 200,000, with numerous local riders weakening it further in some areas.\n\n===Internal and external challenges===\nThe decline in working conditions in the freight industry, combined with long-simmering unhappiness among members employed by the [[United Parcel Service]], led to the development of two nationwide dissident groups within the union in the 1980s: [[Teamsters for a Democratic Union]] (TDU), an assemblage of a number of local efforts, and the Professional Drivers Council, better known as PROD, which began as a public interest group affiliated with [[Ralph Nader]] that was concerned with worker safety. The two groups merged in 1979.\n\nTDU was able to win some local offices within the union, although the International Union often attempted to make those victories meaningless by marginalizing the officer or the union. TDU acquired greater prominence, however, with the election reforms forced on the union by the consent decree it had entered into in 1989 on the eve of trial on a suit brought by the federal government under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO).\n\nThe decree required the direct election of International officers by the membership, as TDU had been demanding for years leading up to the decree, to replace the indirect election by delegates at the union's convention. While the delegates at the union's 1991 convention balked at amending the Constitution, they ultimately capitulated under pressure from the government.\n\nThat consent decree might not have been possible, however, if it had not been for the testimony of [[Roy Lee Williams|Roy Williams]], who described, in an affidavit he gave the government in return for a delay of his imprisonment, his own dealings with organized crime as the Secretary-Treasurer of a local union in Kansas City and as an officer of the International Union. The decree also gave the government the power to install an Independent Review Board with the power to expel any member of the union for \"conduct unbecoming to the union\", which the IRB proceeded to exercise far more aggressively than the Teamsters officials who had agreed to the decree had expected.\n\nWhile the government was pursuing a civil case against the union as an entity it was also indicting Presser, who had succeeded Williams as General President, for embezzling from two different local unions in Cleveland prior to his election as President.

Durham and Walter Shea. Carey's slate, supported by TDU, also won nearly all of the seats on the International Executive Board.\n\nCarey acquired a fair amount of influence within the AFL-CIO, which had readmitted the Teamsters in 1985. Carey was close with the new leadership elected in 1995, particularly [[Richard Trumka]] of the [[United Mine Workers of America]], who became Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO under [[John Sweeney (labor leader)|John Sweeney]]. Carey had also swung the Teamsters support behind the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]], a change from past administrations that had supported the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. The new administration set out to break from the past in other ways, making energetic efforts to head off a vote to oust the union as representative of [[Northwest Airlines]]' flight attendants, negotiating a breakthrough agreement covering carhaulers, and supporting local strikes, such as the one against [[Diamond Walnut]], to restore the union's strength.\n\nThe Carey administration did not, on the other hand, have much power in the lower reaches of the Teamster hierarchy: all of the large regional conferences were run by \"old guard\" officers, as were most of the locals. Disagreements between those two camps led the old guard to campaign against the Carey administration's proposed dues increase; the Carey administration retaliated by dissolving the regional conferences, calling them expensive redundancies and fiefdoms for old guard union officers. and rearranging the boundaries of some joint councils that had fought against the dues increase.\n\nThe opposition responded by uniting around a single candidate, [[James P. Hoffa]], son of James R. Hoffa, to run against Carey in 1996. Hoffa ran a strong campaign, trading on the mystique still attached to his late father's name and promising to restore those days of glory. Carey appeared, however, to have won a close election.\n\nShortly afterward in 1997, the union initiated a large and successful strike against [[United Parcel Service|UPS]].  The parcel services department by that time had become the largest division in the union.\n\nCarey was removed from the union's leadership by the IRB shortly thereafter, when evidence that individuals in his office had arranged for transfer of several thousand dollars to an outside contractor, which then arranged for another entity to make an equivalent contribution to the Carey campaign. Carey was indicted for lying to investigators about his campaign funding but was acquitted of all charges in a 2001 trial.\n\nIn the 1998 [[election]] to succeed Carey, James P. Hoffa was elected handily. He became president of the Teamsters on March 19, 1999, and took the union in a more moderate direction, tempering the union's support for Democrats and attempting to come to terms with powerful Republicans in Congress.\n\nThe union has merged in recent years with a number of unions from other industries, including the [[Graphic Communications International Union]], a printing industry union, and the [[Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes]] and [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers]], both from the railway industry.\n\nOn July 25, 2005, the Teamsters disaffiliated from the [[AFL-CIO]] and became a founding member of the new [[national trade union center]], the [[Change to Win Federation]].<ref>Amber and Bologna, \"Departure of SEIU, Teamsters Creates Split Within AFL-CIO on Convention's Opening Day,\" ''Labor Relations Week,'' July 28, 2005.</ref>\n\nIn 2009, [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], many employees of which are members of the Teamsters, [[lobbying|lobbied]] to have language added to the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2009 (H.R. 915) to change how UPS and [[FedEx]] compete with one another.  In response, FedEx launched a large, online advertising campaign aimed at UPS and the Teamsters, called 'Stop the [[Brown Bailout]]'.\n\n==Internal Teamsters politics==\nPrior to the 1970s, no long-lived caucuses existed within the Teamsters union. Challengers for office ran on their personal appeal and individual power base, rather than on caucus or \"party\" platforms and such challenges were infrequent. The Teamster leadership was well-established and somewhat self-perpetuating, and challengers only rarely achieved victories at the local and (even less frequently) regional levels.<ref>Tillman, p. 139-140.</ref> This changed in the 1970s. A national [[wildcat strike]] challenged President Frank Fitzsimmons' control over the union, but failed. After the strike, a reform movement known as \"Teamsters United Rank and File\" (TURF) formed to continue to challenge against the union's national leadership. But TURF collapsed after a few years due to internal dissent.<ref name=\"Jacobs111\" /> In 1975, two new caucuses formed: Teamsters for a Decent Contract (TDC) and UPSurge. Both groups pushed the national leadership for a vastly improved contract at the UPS freight and shipping company.<ref name=\"Jacobs111\" />\n\nIn 1976 a new formal caucus, [[Teamsters for a Democratic Union]] (TDU), formed when TDC and UPSurge merged. The new caucus' goal was to make internal Teamster governance more transparent and democratic, which included giving rank-and-file more of a say in the terms and approval of contracts.<ref name=\"Ryan418\">Ryan, p. 418.</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, TDU occasionally won elections for positions on local councils, but it was not until 1983\u2014when the TDU forced President Jackie Presser to withdraw and make changes to a concession-laden National Master Freight Agreement\u2014that TDU had a national impact.<ref>Tillman, p. 140.</ref> TDU publicized the very centralized and not very transparent national union decision-making process, criticized what it said was lack of member input into these decisions, and published contract, salary, membership, and other data critical of the national union leadership. These criticisms led to another success for TDU, with many TDU proposals finding their way into the 1988 court decree in which the federal government took over of the Teamsters.<ref name=\"Ryan418\" /><ref>http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1988/06/29/page/1/article/u-s-sues-to-oust-top-teamsters</ref> Although the TDU has never won the presidency of the national union as of mid-2013, it strongly supported Ron Carey for the presidency in 1991. Carey, in turn, adopted many of TDU's reform proposals as part of his platform. Carey ran with nearly a full slate (which included a candidate for secretary-treasurer and 13 vice presidencies).<ref>Only 10 of the 13 candidates running on Carey's slate were members of TDU. The Carey slate did not contest three of the seats on the Teamsters executive board. See: Kilborn, Peter T.

Durham, leader of the Teamsters in North Carolina, was considered the \"establishment\" candidate and front-runner in the campaign (he had the backing of a majority of the union's executive board). A second candidate in the race, Walter Shea, was a veteran union staffer from Washington, D.C. Carey won with 48.5 percent of the vote to Durham's 33.2 percent and Shea's 18.3 percent. (Turnout was low, only about 32 percent of the union's total membership.)<ref>McFadden, Robert D.

Hoffa (son of the former union president). Prior to entering the race, Hoffa formed a caucus of his own, the \"Hoffa Unity Slate\", to counter the grassroots organizing of TDU and Carey.<ref>Jacobs and Cooperman, p. 146.</ref> Carey was later ousted as union president by U.S. government officials.
