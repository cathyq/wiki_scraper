Its chief tenant is [[The New York Times Company]], [[publisher]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' as well as the ''[[International New York Times]]'', and other newspapers. Construction was by a joint venture of The New York Times Company, [[Forest City Ratner]] ([[Forest City Enterprises]]'s New York subsidiary), and [[ING Group|ING Real Estate]].\n\n==History==\n\n\nThe original newspaper headquarters in 1851 were at 113 Nassau Street, in a little building that stood until fairly recently, then up the street a few years later at 138 Nassau Street. In 1858, the Times then moved to a five-story edifice at [[41 Park Row]]; thirty years later, partially in response to a new tower erected by the competing [[New York Tribune|Tribune]], it commissioned a new [[New York Times Building (41 Park Row)|13-story building at the same site]], one that remains in use by [[Pace University]]. In 1904, again partially in response to the [[Herald Square]] headquarters of another [[New York Herald|competitor]], the paper moved to perhaps its most famous location, the [[One Times Square|Times Tower]], altering the name of the surrounding area from [[Longacre Square]] to [[Times Square]]. The slender tower was so constricted in space that the paper outgrew it within a decade and, in 1913, moved into the Times Annex, 229 West 43rd Street, where it remained for almost a century.<ref>David Dunlap, [http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/news/150th-anniversary-1851-2001-six-buildings-that-share-one-story.html \"150th Anniversary: 1851-2001; Six Buildings That Share One Story,\"] in the ''New York Times,'' 11 November 2001.</ref>\n\n===New building ===\n\n[[File:NY Height Comparison.png|thumb|left|250px|alt=Height comparison of New York City buildings|Height comparison of New York City buildings, with the New York Times Building on the right]]\n\nThe project was announced on December 13, 2001, entailing the erection of a 52-story tower on the east side of [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] between 40th and 41st Street across from the [[Port Authority of New York & New Jersey Bus Terminal]]. The project, in conjunction with the [[Hearst Tower (New York City)|Hearst Tower]], represents the further westward expansion of Midtown along Eighth Avenue, a corridor that had seen no construction following the completion in 1989 of [[One Worldwide Plaza]]. In addition, the new building\u2014called by many New Yorkers \"The New Times Tower\"\u2014keeps the paper in the [[Times Square]] area, which was named after the paper following its move to the original Times Tower on [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] in 1904. (The New York Times Company subsequently relocated to nearby 229 West 43rd Street in 1913.)\n\nThe site for the building was obtained by the [[Empire State Development Corporation]] (ESDC) through [[eminent domain]]. With a mandate to acquire and redevelop [[urban decay|blighted]] properties in Times Square, ten existing buildings were condemned by the ESDC and purchased from owners who in some cases did not want to sell, asserting that the area was no longer blighted. The ESDC, however, prevailed in the courts.<ref name=\"nyt_20011025\">{{Cite news | last=Dunlap | first=David W. | title= Blight to Some Is Home to Others; Concern Over Displacement by a New Times Building | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | date=2001-10-25 | url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E3D61231F936A15753C1A9679C8B63 | postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The lighting design for the building's nighttime identity was designed by the Office for Visual Interaction Inc.<ref>[http://www.oviinc.com Office for Visual Interaction Inc.]</ref> The tower rises {{convert|748|ft|m}} from the street to its roof, with the exterior curtain wall extending {{convert|92|ft|m}} higher to {{convert|840|ft|m}}, and a mast rising to {{convert|1046|ft|m}}. {{As of|2010}}, the building was tied with the [[Chrysler Building]] as the fourth-tallest building in New York City, due to the unfinished [[One World Trade Center]] exceeding their height. The tower is also the [[Tallest buildings in the United States|seventh-tallest]] building in the United States. \n\nThe [[steel-framed building]], [[cruciform]] in plan, has a screen of {{frac|1|5|8}}\" (41.3&nbsp;mm) ceramic rods mounted on the exterior of the glass curtain wall on the east, west and south facades. The rod spacing increases from the base to the top, adding transparency as the building rises. The steel framing and bracing is exposed at the four corner \"notches\" of the building.<ref name=\"gostructural_20040615\">{{Cite news | title=A statement in steel: The New York Times Building | newspaper=GoStructural.com | date=2004-06-15 | url=http://www.gostructural.com/article.asp?id=603 | accessdate=2007-11-29 | postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The design incorporates numerous environmentally sustainable features for increased energy efficiency. The double skin curtain wall, automated louver shading system, dimmable lighting system, [[Underfloor air distribution|underfloor air distribution system]] and [[cogeneration]] are the main sustainable design features.<ref name=\"sciencebeat_20040217\">{{Cite news | title=The New York Times Building: Designing for Energy Efficiency Through Daylighting Research | newspaper=Science Beat | date=2004-02-17 | url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/sb-EETD-NYT-building.html | accessdate=2007-11-29 | postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The ceramic tubing aesthetically functions as a canvas with the environment conditions, changing color according to the sun and weather by gently reflecting light throughout the day. This exterior layer also allows the use of floor-to-ceiling ultra-clear glass that maximizes light and views for people both inside and outside the building. To optimize views, rods are spaced to allow occupants to have unobstructed views while both seated and standing. Aluminum silicate, an extremely dense and high-quality ceramic used for special manufacturing purposes, was chosen for its long-term durability and cost-effectiveness. The silicate rods were glazed with a finish similar to the material used on terra cotta to reflect light, self-clean, and ensure its resistance to weather. Additionally, the automated louver shading system is programmed to move in response to the position of the sun and inputs from sensor network to determine to raise or lower the shades, either blocking extreme light to reduce glare or allowing light to enter at times of less direct sunlight. With both systems working together, it is capable of limiting the building\u2019s energy consumption by reducing 30% of solar heat gain and approximately 13% of energy costs by cooling loads.<ref name=\"sciencebeat_20040217\" /><ref name=\"CTBUH Technical Paper\">{{Cite news | title=Times Square Skyscraper: Sustainability Reaching New Heights | date=2004 | url=http://ctbuh.org/Portals/0/Repository/Jambhekar_2004_TimesSquareSkyscrapers.587097b5-3224-45e1-8b38-fb1110b12bf4.pdf | postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to \".\" for the cite to end in a \".\", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}} }}</ref>\n\n====Dimmable Lighting System====\n\nNormally in an office building, lighting accounts for approximately 44% of electrical consumption. Complementing the curtain wall and shading design, the lighting system aims to use daylight harvesting as the primary natural light sources for offices so that electric lighting serves as a supplement. The electric lighting responds to occupancy and also changes with daylight. Each of the more than 18,000 [[electrical ballast]]s in the lighting system contains a computer chip that enables its individual control, which means lighting levels are adjustable to meet the needs at different spaces operating varying levels of light with maximum efficiency.  The daylighting and shading systems work in concert to ensure that the building efficiently uses natural light whenever possible.<ref>http://kaitybadlato.wordpress.com/2011/11/08/new-york-times-building-sustainable-systems/</ref>\n\n====Underfloor Air Distribution (UFAD)====\n\nThe New York Times Company utilizes the [[Underfloor air distribution|underfloor air distribution system]] which strives for better [[indoor air quality]], [[thermal comfort]] as well as energy saving. The conditioned air from the air handler is delivered through an air highway system that circumnavigates the service core and then into the six zoned off underfloor low pressure zones for distribution across the floor plate to all floor diffusers. Around each perimeter a series of fan power boxes control the temperature in the space. If heating is required then the fans turn on delivering heat via a hot water coil. In cooling mode, the fans operate to give increased ventilation around the perimeter spaces. Fresh air is supplied by two air handling units on the 28th floor sending fresh treated outside air to each floor where a constant volume VAV controls the amount of air entering the system. The air is then conditioned for proper cooling and humidity before being sent to the air highway. The New York Times Building also benefits from other general UFAD advantages. In the open plan office space that was implemented in occupied space from 2nd to 21st floors to enhance daylighting and outdoor views, the system provides flexibility to place the required equipment anywhere on the raised integrated service plenum. When departments or occupants needed to be reconfigured, the raised floor also enables maintenance to carry out changes at relatively lower expense.<ref name=\"POE\" /><ref name=\"UFAD\">{{cite report |title=Underfloor Air Distribution in a Commercial High Rise:The New York Times Headquarters |publisher=National Conference on Building Commissioning |date=May 2007| url=http://www.bcxa.org/ncbc/2007/proceedings/English_NCBC2007.pdf}}</ref>\n\n====Cogeneration on site====\n\nThe New York Times Building incorporates a [[cogeneration]] plant to supply its 24-7 operation and 40% of the power used. Located in a mechanical room at the far end of the podium\u2019s top floor, the plant consists of two natural gas fired reciprocating engine driven generators with a total generating capacity of 1.5 MW of electrical power. It recovers the heat produced by combustion and converts the heat into usable energy in the form of hot water. The recovered hot water serves as the building\u2019s heating loop to provide warmth during the winter and functions as a refrigeration machine to provide cooling during the summer. The power from the grid is solely used by the building as a backup source.<ref name=\"CTBUH Technical Paper\" />\n\n====Other Features====\n\nIn excess of 95% of the structural steel was recycled. The building, like many in [[midtown Manhattan]], has no on-site parking, with most employees arriving by [[public transit]].<ref name=\"streetsblog_20071206\">{{cite web | title=New York Times Employees Say Renzo Forgot the Bike Parking | date=2007-12-06 | url=http://www.streetsblog.org/2007/12/06/new-york-times-employees-say-renzo-forgot-the-bike-parking/#more-2983 | accessdate=2007-12-06 }}</ref>\n\n====Overall Performance====\n\nA team of researchers at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Lawrence Berkeley National Lab]] and [[Center for the Built Environment]] monitored the building\u2019s performance for a year and compared the results with buildings that meet with the standard building efficiency codes. They found that the New York Times Building significantly reduced annual electricity, cut heating energy use by more than 50% and decrease the peak electric demand as well. \"It is essential to start with a sound, integrated building design, and then to pay attention to details such as procurement of building equipment, and verifying the proper performance of the equipment after it is installed. The Times Company did its homework in 2004, well before construction began on the building, evaluating and optimizing the shading and daylighting technologies,\" concluded the Berkeley researchers.<ref name=\"POE\">{{cite report |title=A Post-Occupancy Monitored Evaluation of the Dimmable Lighting, Automated Shading, and Underfloor Air Distribution System in The New York Times Building |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and University of California Berkeley|date=January 2013| url=http://buildings.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/lbnl-6023e.pdf}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Why the New York Times Building Is Saving So Much Energy\">{{Cite news | title=Why the New York Times Building Is Saving So Much Energy | date=2013 | url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/look-at-how-much-energy-the-new-york-times-building-saved | postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.
