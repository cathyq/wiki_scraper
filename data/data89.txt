W. Eidlitz]] ([[HLW International]]), located at [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in [[New York City]]. The tower was originally built to serve as the headquarters of the local [[newspaper]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (which also gave its name to the area as a whole, known as [[Times Square]]); however, the ''Times'' stayed in the building for less than 10 years before moving to a new building on [[The Times Square Building|229 West 43rd Street]].\n\nDespite the ''Times'' leaving the building, One Times Square remained a major focal point of [[Times Square]] due to its annual [[New Year's Eve]] \"[[Times Square Ball|ball drop]]\" festivities (the ball itself has remained atop the tower year-round since 2009), and the introduction of an electronic [[news ticker]] at street-level in 1928. Following its sale to [[Lehman Brothers]] in 1995, One Times Square was re-purposed as an [[advertising]] location to take advantage of its prime location within the square. Most of the building's interior remains vacant (aside from its only major tenant, a [[Walgreens]] pharmacy which occupies its lower levels), while its exterior features a large number of traditional and electronic [[billboard]]s. Due to the large amount of revenue that its ads pull, One Times Square is considered one of the most valuable advertising locations in the world.\n\n==Building history==\n[[File:One Times Square under construction 1903.jpg|thumb|left|220px|One Times Square under construction in 1903]]\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|width=220\n|image1=Crowd gathers for updates to 1919 World Series.JPG|caption1=One Times Square as seen in 1919...\n|image2=Times Square, NY.jpeg|caption2=...and in 2011}}\nThe building, on the site of the [[Pabst Hotel]], was originally completed in 1904 to serve as the new headquarters of ''[[The New York Times]]'', which officially moved into the building in January 1905. The paper's owner, [[Adolph Ochs]], also successfully persuaded the city to rename the surrounding area (then known as [[Longacre Square]]) after the newspaper, becoming [[Times Square]].<ref name=nyt-times1904>{{cite web|title=100 Years Ago, an Intersection's New Name: Times Square|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/08/nyregion/100-years-ago-an-intersection-s-new-name-times-square.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref> To help promote the new headquarters, the ''Times'' held a [[New Year's Eve]] event on December 31, 1903, welcoming the year of 1904 with a fireworks display set off from the roof of the building at midnight. The event was a success, attracting 200,000 spectators, and was continued annually until 1907. For 1908, Ochs replaced the display with what he thought would be a more spectacular event{{emdash}}the lowering of a [[Times Square Ball|lit ball]] down the building's flagpole at midnight, patterned off the use of [[time ball]]s to indicate a certain time of day (the \"ball drop\" is still held on One Times Square to this day, attracting an average of one million spectators yearly).<ref name=\"Green\">{{cite news\n|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/12/31/new.year.us/?iref=mpstoryview\n|title=NYC ball drop goes 'green' on 100th anniversary\n|publisher=CNN\n|date=December 31, 2007\n|accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref> \n\nIn 1913, only eight years after it moved to One Times Square, the ''Times'' moved its corporate headquarters to [[The Times Square Building|229 West 43rd Street]], which served as its home from 1913 to 2007. The ''Times'' has since moved to [[The New York Times Building]] on nearby [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]]. After leaving One Times Square, the ''Times'' still maintained ownership of the tower.<ref name=telegraph-history>{{cite web|title=History of Times Square|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8664743/History-of-Times-Square.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=wired-tsticker/><ref name=\"nytb-factsheet\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.newyorktimesbuilding.com/pdf/FactSheet2007.pdf |title=The New York Times Company Enters The 21st Century With A New Technologically Advanced And Environmentally Sensitive Headquarters |date=November 19, 2007 |publisher = The New York Times Company}}</ref>\n\nOn November 6, 1928, an electronic [[news ticker]] known as the ''Motograph News Bulletin'' (colloquially known as the \"zipper\") was introduced near the base of the building. The zipper originally consisted of 14,800 light bulbs, with the display controlled by a [[chain conveyor]] system inside the building; individual letter elements (a form of [[movable type]]) were loaded into frames to spell out news headlines. As the frames moved along the conveyor, the letters themselves triggered [[electrical contacts]] which lit the external bulbs (the zipper has since been upgraded to use modern [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] technology).<ref name=wired-tsticker>{{cite web|last=Long|first=Tony|title=Nov. 6, 1928: All the News That's Lit|url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/11/dayintech_1106|publisher=Wired|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref> The first headline displayed on the zipper announced [[Herbert Hoover]]'s victory in that day's [[United States presidential election, 1928|presidential election]]. The zipper was used to display other major news headlines of the era, and its content later expanded to include sports and weather updates as well.<ref name=wired-tsticker/> On the evening of [[Victory over Japan Day|August 14, 1945]], the zipper was famously used to announce [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] from [[World War II]] to a packed crowd in Times Square.<ref name=nyt-lightsout/>\n\nThe ''Times'' sold the building to advertising executive and sign designer [[Douglas Leigh]] in 1961. Leigh then sold the building to [[Honeywell|Allied Chemical]] in 1963. Allied Chemical greatly modified the building's facade in a $10 million renovation, replacing intricate [[granite]] and [[terracotta]] elements with [[marble]] facing. In 1974, the building was sold to investor Alex Parker for $6.25 million, and then to the Swiss-based investment group Kemekod. Kemekod later sold the tower to an investment group led by Lawrence I. Linksman in 1982. Linksman promised further renovations to the building, including the possibility of using its north face for signage displays.<ref name=nyt-newowner>{{cite web|title=A NEW OWNER TAKES THE REINS IN TIMES SQUARE|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/03/realestate/a-new-owner-takes-the-reins-in-times-square.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=15 January 2013}}</ref>  Following the sale of the building by the ''Times'', the zipper was operated on an inconsistent basis by various news outlets, and was shut off entirely between 1961 to 1965, and again from 1977 to 1986. In 1986, the ticker was revived by ''[[Newsday]]'', which operated it until December 31, 1994. The newspaper declined to renew its lease on the ticker, believing that they \"[didn't] get very much out of that sign\" financially.<ref name=nyt-lightsout>{{cite web|title=Lights Out for Times Square News Sign?|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/11/nyregion/lights-out-for-times-square-news-sign.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=20 January 2013}}</ref> Publishing company [[Pearson PLC]] operated the zipper for a period beginning on December 31, 1994, until ceding its role to [[Dow Jones & Company]] in June 1995.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dow Jones taking over news 'zipper'|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wcpFAAAAIBAJ&sjid=os8MAAAAIBAJ&pg=6800,5554895&dq=times+square+zipper&hl=en|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=20 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=nyt-dowjonesticker>{{cite web|title=Update: Times Square keeps its zip after all|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oR4eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=On8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=3695,4530131&dq=times+square+zipper&hl=en|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=20 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1990 to 1996, [[Sony]] operated a [[Jumbotron]] on the exterior of the tower. Alongside its use for advertising and news, it was also frequently used by the producers of the [[late-night talk show]] ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', who could display a live feed from its studio on the screen as well. As a cost-saving measure, Sony declined to renew its lease of the space, leading to the subsequent removal of the Jumbotron in June 1996. Due to its frequent use by ''Late Show'', its producer [[Rob Burnett (producer)|Rob Burnett]] jokingly considered the removal of the Jumbotron to be \"a sad, sad day for New York.\"<ref name=nyt-nojumbo>{{cite web|title=Less Glitter on Times Square: No More Jumbotron|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/17/nyregion/less-glitter-on-times-square-no-more-jumbotron.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Billboards==\n[[File:NYC - Times Square - 0420.jpg|thumb|left|220px|One Times Square in 2005, featuring the former Cup Noodles billboard and NBC Astrovision]]\n[[File:Times Square Walgreens, NYC.jpg|thumb|left|220px|In 2008, [[Walgreens]] opened a new flagship location at One Times Square.]]\n\nIn 1992, the owners of One Times Square filed for [[Bankruptcy|bankruptcy protection]].<ref name=nyt-lightsout/> In March 1995, One Times Square was sold to the financial services firm [[Lehman Brothers]] for $27.5 million. The new owners felt that it would not be cost-effective to house new tenants in the tower due to the cost of the extensive renovation required in order to make it suitable for tenants as compared to the relatively small rental revenue that its limited floor space would have brought in. Instead, they decided to market the tower as a location for advertising to capitalize on its prominent location within the Square.
