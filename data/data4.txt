It is host to feature articles longer than those typically in the newspaper and has attracted many notable contributors. The magazine is also noted for its photography, especially relating to fashion and style.\n\n==History==\nIts first issue was published on September 6, 1896, and contained the first photographs ever printed in the newspaper.<ref name= \"time\">The New York Times Company.

Retrieved on 2009-03-13.</ref> In the early decades it was a section of the broadsheet paper and not an insert as it is today. The creation of a \"serious\" Sunday magazine was part of a massive overhaul of the newspaper instigated that year by its new owner, [[Adolph Ochs]], who also banned [[fiction]], [[comic strips]] and [[gossip column]]s from the paper, and is generally credited with saving ''The New York Times'' from financial ruin.<ref name= \"seventy\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915282,00.html \"The Kingdom and the Cabbage\"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 1977-08-15.

E. B. Du Bois]] and [[Albert Einstein]] to numerous sitting and future [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]].<ref name= \"fivethou\"/> Editor [[Lester Markel]], an \"intense and [[autocratic]]\" journalist who oversaw the Sunday ''Times'' from the 1920s through the 1950s, encouraged the idea of the magazine as a forum for ideas.<ref name= \"fivethou\"/> During his tenure, writers such as [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Gertrude Stein]], and [[Tennessee Williams]] contributed pieces to the magazine. When, in 1970, ''The New York Times'' introduced its first [[Op-Ed]] page, the magazine shifted away from publishing as many editorial pieces.<ref name= \"fivethou\"/>\n\nIn 1979, the magazine began publishing [[Pulitzer Prize]]\u2013winning journalist [[William Safire]]'s \"[[On Language]]\", a column discussing issues of English grammar, use and [[etymology]]. Safire's column steadily gained popularity and by 1990 was generating \"more mail than anything else\" in the magazine.<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,317950,00.html \"Language Maven Strikes Again\"], ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', 1990-08-10.

In 2011, [[Ariel Kaminer]] replaced Cohen as the author of the column, and in 2012 [[Chuck Klosterman]] replaced Kaminer. Klosterman left in early 2015 to be replaced by a trio of authors -- [[Kenji Yoshino]], [[Amy Bloom]], and [[Jack Shafer]]\u2014who use a conversational format. \"Consumed\", [[Rob Walker (journalist)|Rob Walker]]'s regular column on consumer culture, debuted in 2004. The Sunday ''Magazine'' also features a [[The New York Times crossword puzzle|puzzle page]], edited by [[Will Shortz]], that features a [[crossword puzzle]] with a larger grid than those featured in the ''Times'' during the week, along with other types of puzzles on a rotating basis (including [[Crossword#Diagramless crosswords|diagramless]] crossword puzzles and [[anacrostic]]s).\n\nIn September 2010, as part of a greater effort to reinvigorate the magazine, ''Times'' editor [[Bill Keller]] hired former staff member and then-editor of ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'', [[Hugo Lindgren]], as the editor of ''The New York Times Magazine''.<ref name= \"LindgrenEditor\">{{cite news |last=Peters |first=Jeremy |url= http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/hugo-lindgren-named-editor-of-the-times-magazine/ |title= Hugo Lindgren Named Editor of The Times Magazine |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2010-09-30 |accessdate=2010-10-23}}</ref>  As part of a series of new staff hires upon assuming his new role, Lindgren first hired then\u2013executive editor of ''O: The Oprah Magazine'' [[Lauren Kern]] to be his deputy editor <ref name= \"Kern\">{{cite news |last=Peters |first=Jeremy |url= http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/11/times-names-deputy-magazine-editor/?pagemode=print |title= Times Names Deputy Magazine Editor |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2010-10-11 |accessdate=2010-10-23}}</ref> and then hired then-editor of TNR.com, ''[[The New Republic]]'' magazine's website, [[Greg Veis]], to edit the \"front of the book\" section of the magazine.<ref name= \"VeisFront\">{{cite news |url= http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/10/tnrs_greg_veis_to_the_new_york.html |title= TNR\u2019s Greg Veis to The New York Times Magazine |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=2010-10-22 |accessdate=2010-10-23}}</ref> In December 2010, Lindgren hired Joel Lovell, formerly story editor at ''[[GQ]]'' magazine, as deputy editor.<ref>Summers, Nick.
