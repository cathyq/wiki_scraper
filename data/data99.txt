"This is a list of adult [[fiction]] books that topped '''[[List of The New York Times Fiction Best Sellers|''The New York Times'' Fiction Best Seller list]] in 1948'''.\n\nThe American publisher [[Bennett Cerf]] noted that there had been \"only three novels published [in 1948] that were worth reading ... ''[[Cry, The Beloved Country]]'', ''[[The Ides of March (novel)|The Ides of March]]'', and ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]''.\"<ref name=\"rd\">(No author.) \"Reader's digest: Gossip, news: J. F. Albright reports on A.B.A. meeting,\" ''The Dallas Morning News'', 30 May 1948, page 6.</ref> Only ''Cry'' did not top the list that year. A total of ten other novels did, however, with most titles spending only a few weeks at the top. The strongest performing title was ''The Naked and the Dead'', [[Norman Mailer]]'s first best seller, published when he was just 25 years old, which spent 19 weeks at Number 1 and more than 6 months in the top 10. It was the first \"big\" novel about [[World War II]], based on his own experiences. ''The Ides of March'' was by [[Thornton Wilder]] and it spent 2 weeks at Number 1 but only 13 weeks in the top 15. The year ended with ''[[The Big Fisherman]]'' heading the list, [[Lloyd C. Douglas]]'s follow-up to his huge 1942 best seller, ''The Robe''.<ref>[[John Bear]], ''The #1 New York Times Best Seller: intriguing facts about the 484 books that have been #1 New York Times bestsellers since the first list, 50 years ago'', Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1992, pp. 31-39</ref>\n[[Image:TheNakedAndTheDead.jpg|thumb|Norman Mailer's fictional account set during World War II ''The Naked and the Dead'' was the big novel of 1948.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|- \n!Date\n!Book\n!Author\n|-\n| January 3 || rowspan=5|''House Divided'' || rowspan=5|[[Ben Ames Williams]]\n|-\n| January 10\n|-\n| January 17\n|-\n| January 24\n|-\n| January 31\n|-\n| February 7 || rowspan=2|''East Side, West Side'' || rowspan=2|[[Marcia Davenport]]\n|-\n| February 14\n|-\n| February 21 || rowspan=2|''House Divided'' || rowspan=2|Ben Ames William\n|-\n| February 28\n|-\n| March 7 || rowspan=4|''Eagle in the Sky'' || rowspan=4|[[F.
