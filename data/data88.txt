Thus, it appears he had three days of overlapping service.-->\n\n'''Byron William Brown II''' (born September 24, 1958) is the 62nd and current [[List of mayors of Buffalo, New York|mayor]] of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York]], elected on November 8, 2005 and is the city's first [[African-American]] mayor. He previously served [[Western New York]] as a member of the [[New York State Senate]] and [[Buffalo Common Council]]. He was the first African-American politician elected to the New York State Senate to represent a district outside [[New York City]] and the first member of any minority race to represent a majority white New York State Senate district.\n\nBrown was born and raised in [[Queens, New York]]. He rose to elective office after serving in a variety of political roles.  He began his political career performing as an aide to local representatives in several legislative bodies (Buffalo Common Council, Erie County Legislature and [[New York State Assembly]]) and later getting involved in a regional political organization. After several roles as a legislative aide, he was appointed to the [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet-level]] Director of Equal Employment Opportunity post.\n\nAs both a New York State Senator and Buffalo Mayor, he has been closely involved in the development of the three [[Seneca Nation]] casinos that have been planned and built in Western New York since 2002. As someone born and raised [[Downstate New York|downstate]] who went on to become an [[Upstate New York|upstate]] political servant, he has been active on the statewide political front. He is a close political ally of [[New York Governor]] [[Andrew Cuomo]]. He has also been active with the National [[Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition]] in efforts to prevent gun-related crime. His plan to revitalize Buffalo by demolishing its abundant vacant buildings has drawn opposition from [[historic preservation]]ists, but he has made the development of the Buffalo waterfront a priority.\n\n== Background ==\nBrown was born on September 24, 1958 in Queens,<ref name=OMSAgm/> He was raised in [[Hollis, Queens|Hollis]], a southeastern neighborhood in New York City's [[Queens, New York|Queens borough]], in a [[Duplex (building)|double]] that his family shared with his grandparents, who were immigrants from the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Montserrat]].<ref name=Twwbm/> He grew up on 200th Street between 100th and 104th Avenues and has several relatives still in the area.<ref name=ItblBBictsatfAmoB/> As a Queens resident, he was a [[New York Mets]] and [[New York Knicks]] fan.<ref name=OMSAgm>{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/opinioncolumns/columns/offmainstreet/story/449269.html|title=Off Main Street: A giving mood&nbsp;...|accessdate=2008-11-23|date=2008-09-27|work=[[The Buffalo News]]|author=Watson, Stephen T.|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080930004738/http://www.buffalonews.com/opinioncolumns/columns/offmainstreet/story/449269.html <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=2008-09-30}}</ref><ref name=Twwbm>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:BNWB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10D0995C89AD4B80&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Two who would be mayor - An achiever since boyhood, Brown is disciplined, polished -- and 'sphinxlike'|accessdate=2008-11-23|date=2005-10-02|publisher=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[The Buffalo News]]|author=Fairbanks, Phil}}</ref>\n\nBrown's father rose from a job as a stock boy to one as an executive in the garment industry.<ref name=Twwbm/> He was a [[Boy Scout]] at Hollis Presbyterian Church in Queens and was also active in the Central Queens YMCA (now called [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]] [[YMCA]]).<ref name=ItblBBictsatfAmoB>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:NWDB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=110699A4D196D2A8&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=In the big league Byron Brown is calling the shots as the first African-American mayor of Buffalo |accessdate=2008-11-23|date=2006-03-17|publisher=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[Newsday]]|author=Cassese, Sid}}</ref> In high school, Brown played the trumpet in the school band.<ref name=Twwbm/>  Brown attended Public School&nbsp;134 in Hollis, junior high school PS&nbsp;109, and [[August Martin High School]].<ref name=Twwbm/><ref name=ItblBBictsatfAmoB/> Brown and his sister Andrea were the first generation in his family to go to college.<ref name=Twwbm/>\n\nAfter graduating from August Martin High School<ref name=Twwbm/> Brown attended [[Buffalo State College]], in part due to grudging admiration for [[Randy Smith (basketball)|Randy Smith]].<ref name=Twwbm/><ref name=\"Staba2006\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/28/nyregion/28oldhome.html|title=To Burnish Its Image, a City Stages an Alumni Reunion |accessdate=2008-11-23|date=2006-08-28|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Staba, David}}</ref> He played a year of [[Junior Varsity]] basketball as a {{convert|5|ft|11|in|m|adj=on}} [[guard (basketball)|guard]].
