"This is a list of adult [[fiction]] books that topped '''[[List of The New York Times Fiction Best Sellers|''The New York Times'' Fiction Best Seller list]] in 1946'''. The most popular title was ''The Hucksters'' which spent much of the latter half of the year (19 weeks) at the top of the list and a total of 35 weeks among the top 15. During its reign at the top, it was challenged, but never toppled, by two recognized classics, George Orwell's ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and Robert Penn Warren's ''[[All the King's Men]]'', neither of which ever reached the top spot.<ref>[[John Bear]], ''The #1 New York Times Best Seller: intriguing facts about the 484 books that have been #1 New York Times bestsellers since the first list, 50 years ago'', Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1992. pp. 21-27</ref> \n[[File:TheKingsGeneral.jpg|thumb|''The King's General'', a novel set during the [[English Civil War]] was Daphne du Maurier's sixth novel and first No. 1 bestseller since the list became a national survey in the US in 1942.]] \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|- \n!Date\n!Book\n!Author\n|-\n| January 6 || rowspan=4|''[[The Black Rose (novel)|The Black Rose]]'' || rowspan=4|[[Thomas B.
