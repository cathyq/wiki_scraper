United States''''', [[Case citation|403 U.S. 713]] (1971), was a landmark     decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. The ruling made it possible for the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[Washington Post]]'' newspapers to publish the then-[[Classified information in the United States|classified]] [[Pentagon Papers]] without risk of government censorship or punishment.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB48/decision.pdf | title =''New York Times Co. v. United States''  | author =''[[George Washington University]]'' | publisher =gwu.edu | date =July 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Richard Nixon|President Richard Nixon]] had claimed [[executive (government)|executive]] authority to force the ''Times'' to [[publication ban|suspend publication]] of classified information in its possession. The question before the court was whether the constitutional [[freedom of the press]], guaranteed by the First Amendment, was subordinate to a claimed need of the executive branch of government to maintain the secrecy of information. The Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment did protect the right of the ''New York Times'' to print the materials.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Section 793 of the Espionage Act===\nSection 793 of the [[Espionage Act]] was cited by Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell]] as cause for the United States to sue to bar further publication of stories based upon the [[Pentagon Papers]].  The statute was spread over three pages of the ''[[United States Code]] Annotated'' and the only part that appeared to apply to the ''Times'' was 793(e), which made it [[criminal law|criminal]] for:\n<blockquote>Whoever having unauthorized possession of, access to, or control over any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, or note relating to the national defense, or information relating to the national defense which information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, willfully communicates, delivers, transmits or causes to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted, or attempts to communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted the same to any person not entitled to receive it, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it.<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/ts_search.pl?title=18&sec=793 Text of Espionage Act at Findlaw.com]</ref></blockquote>\nBased on this language, [[Alexander Bickel]] and [[Floyd Abrams]] felt there were three preliminary arguments to raise.  First, the wording of the statute was very broad.  Was each article about foreign policy one \"relating to the national defense\"?  What was the significance of \"reason to believe\" that the Pentagon Papers \"could be used to the injury of the United States or the advantage of any foreign nation\"?  If the motivation was to educate the public, was that a defense that served to help, not hinder, the country?  Would the public be \"a person not entitled to receive\" the information?  Of equal import was what the statute did not say: No references to \"publication\" (as Attorney General Mitchell's cease-and-desist order referenced), no reference to classified information, and no support for Mitchell's reliance on the top secret classification to justify restraint on publication.  Additionally, there was no statutory language providing authority for prior restraint on publication at all.\n\nSecond, was the relevance of Mitchell's reliance on a criminal statute in a civil proceeding seeking prior restraint.  There was Supreme Court precedent that lent support to the idea that bans on the publication of information by the press to be unconstitutional.  In 1907 Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote the \"main purpose\" of the First Amendment\" was \"to prevent all such previous restraints upon publications as had been practiced by other governments\". In 1931 the Court wrote that only the narrowest circumstances&mdash;such as publication of the dates of departure of ships during wartime&mdash;were permissibly restrained.  In 1969 [[John Marshall Harlan II]] wrote the Supreme Court \"rejected all manner of prior restraint on publication\".  This second line of reasoning made it seem the statute should only be dealt with in passing, making the case a First Amendment one and the relief the government wanted&mdash;a bar on publication&mdash;unavailable.\n\nThe third possible approach was a very broad view of the First Amendment, one not focused on the impact of a government victory on the life of a democratic society if prior restraint were granted; but that the publication of just these sorts of materials&mdash;governmental misjudgments and misconducts of high import&mdash;is exactly why the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] exists.\n\n===Restraining order sought===\nBy 1971, the United States had been overtly [[Vietnam War|at war]] with [[North Vietnam]] for six years. At this point, 59,000 American soldiers had died and the administration was facing widespread dissent from large portions of the American public. In 1967 Secretary of Defense [[Robert S. McNamara]] commissioned a \u201cmassive top-secret history of the United States role in Indochina\u201d. The resulting 2.5 million word classified work was obtained by the ''New York Times'' within three years, which immediately began publishing articles outlining the findings.\n\nThe first article appeared in the ''Times''{{'}} Sunday edition, on June 13, 1971. By the following Tuesday, the ''Times'' received an order to cease further publication from a District Court judge, at the request of the administration. The government claimed it would cause \"irreparable injury to the defense interests of the United States\" and wanted to \"enjoin the ''New York Times'' and the ''Washington Post'' from publishing the contents of a classified study entitled ''History of U.S. Decision-Making Process on the  Vietnam Policy.''\u201d Seen from a constitutional perspective, the Government was expressing its intent to enforce [[prior restraint]] upon a newspaper with regards to publishing the findings of a study that the government itself had made.\n\nThe government sought a [[restraining order]] that barred the ''Times'' from publishing any further articles based upon the Pentagon Papers. In addition to [[The New York Times Company]], the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] named the following defendants: [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger]], president and publisher; [[Harding Bancroft]] and [[Ivan Veit]], executive vice presidents; [[Francis Cox]], [[James Goodale]], [[Sydney Gruson]], [[Walter Mattson]], [[John McCabe (news executive)|John McCabe]], [[John Mortimer]] and [[James Reston]], vice presidents; [[John B. Oakes]], editorial page editor; [[A.&nbsp;M. Rosenthal]], managing editor; [[Daniel Schwarz]], Sunday editor; [[Clifton Daniel]] and [[Tom Wicker]], associate editors; [[Gerald Gold]] and [[Allan Siegal]], assistant foreign editors; [[Neil Sheehan]], [[Hedrick Smith]], [[E.&nbsp;W. Kenworthy]] and [[Fox Butterfield]], reporters; and [[Samuel Abt]], a [[foreign desk]] copy editor.\n\nFederal judge [[Murray Gurfein]] heard arguments.  [[Michael D. Hess|Michael Hess]], chief of the Civil Division of the [[United States Attorneys Office]], argued \"serious injuries are being inflicted on our foreign relations, to the benefit of other nations opposed to our foreign relations, to the benefit of other nations opposed to our form of government\".<ref>Fred Graham, \"[http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/04/13/reviews/papers-injunction.html Court Here Refuses to Order Return of Documents Now]\", ''[[New York Times]]'', June 16, 2010.</ref>  Hess relied on Secretary of State [[William P. Rogers]]'s statement reported earlier that day that a number of nations were concerned about the Papers publication and an affidavit from general counsel of the Navy that alleged irreparable injury if publication did not cease.  Hess asked for a temporary restraining order.\n\nBickel argued that the separation of powers barred the court from issuing the restraining order, since there was no statute authorizing such relief.  He further argued that there was no exception to the general unavailability of prior restraint that applied in this case.  Gurfein called all counsel to his chambers and asked Bickel and Abrams to have the ''Times'' cease publication of the Papers until he could review them.  Bickel responded that Gurfein would be the first judge in American history to enter a prior restraint enjoining publication of news if he granted the government's request.  The ''Times'' refused to cease publication.  Gurfein granted the request and set a hearing for June 18.\n\nThe ''[[New York Times]]'' agreed to abide by the restraining order and on June 19, the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|District Court]] rejected the administration\u2019s request for an injunction, whereas the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Court of Appeals]], after an ''[[en banc]]'' hearing, granted an injunction until June 25.<ref>444 F.2d 544: ''United States of America, Plaintiff-appellant, v. New York Times Company et al., Defendants-appellees'' on [http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/444/544/340930/ Justia]</ref> As for the ''Post'', the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|District Court for the District of Columbia]] rejected the government's request, as well as the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit]]. This inconsistency between the courts of appeal led the Supreme Court to hear the case.\n\n[[Image:NewFloydAbrams.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Floyd Abrams]], counsel to ''The New York Times'']]\nAlong with the issue of how the ''Times'' obtained the documents (which was being investigated by a federal grand jury elsewhere) the real issue for the Court was whether there was a sufficient justification for prior restraint, which would be a suspension of the newspapers\u2019 First Amendment rights to freedom of the press. The First Amendment states that no federal law can be made abridging the freedom of the press, but a few landmark cases in the 20th century had established precedents creating exceptions to that rule.\n\nThe most recent incarnation of the exception was the grave and probable danger rule, established in ''[[Dennis v. United States]]'', {{ussc|341|494|1951}}. During this case, the wording was changed to the grave and irreparable danger standard. The idea behind the numerous versions of the rule is that if a certain message will likely cause a \u201cgrave and irreparable\u201d danger to the American public when expressed, then the message\u2019s prior restraint could be considered an acceptable infringement of civil liberties. The Supreme Court was therefore charged with determining if the Government had sufficiently met the \u201cburden of showing justification for the imposition of such a restraint\u201d .\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments from the Executive Branch, the ''Times'', the ''Post'', and the Justice Department on June 25 and 26, 1971. On June 30, with six Justices concurring and three dissenting, the Supreme Court upheld the right of the two newspapers to publish the material.\n\nIn its decision, the court first established the legal question with the use of precedents. It first stated that \u201cAny system of prior restraints of expression comes to this Court bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity\u201d. The purpose of this statement was to make the presence of the inherent conflict between the Government\u2019s efforts and the First Amendment clear. The decision then stated that the government \u201cthus carries a heavy burden of showing justification for the imposition of such a restraint\u201d. This reinforced the idea that it was the Nixon Administration's responsibility to show sufficient evidence that the newspapers\u2019 actions would cause a \u201cgrave and irreparable\u201d danger.<ref>[http://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1970/1970_1873 ny times/ books]</ref>\n\n==Decision==\nIn a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court agreed with the two lower courts, which had originally decided that the government had not met its \"heavy burden\" of showing a justification for a prior restraint. The Court issued a very brief ''[[per curiam]]'' opinion, stating only that the Court concurred with the decisions of the two lower courts to reject the Government\u2019s request for an injunction.<ref>''New York Times Co. v. United States'', 403 U.S. 713, 714 (1971).</ref>\n\nThe Justices' opinions included different degrees of support for the clear ''superiority'' of the First Amendment and no Justice fully supported the government\u2019s case. Because of these factors, no clear and exclusive verdict appears to have come out of this case. Nevertheless, the significance of the case and the wording of the Justices\u2019 opinions have added important statements to the history of precedents for exceptions to the First Amendment, which have been cited in numerous Supreme Court cases since.\n\n===Concurring opinions===\n\nJustice [[Hugo Black]] wrote an opinion that elaborated on his view of the absolute superiority of the First Amendment:  \n\n:\"[T]he injunction against the ''New York Times'' should have been vacated without oral argument when the cases were first presented ... .  [E]very moment's continuance of the injunctions ... amounts to a flagrant, indefensible, and continuing violation of the First Amendment. ... When the Constitution was adopted, many people strongly opposed it because the document contained no Bill of Rights ... . In response to an overwhelming public clamor, [[James Madison]] offered a series of amendments to satisfy citizens that these great liberties would remain safe ... .  In the First Amendment the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the governors. The Government's power to censor the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to censure the Government. The press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people. Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government. And paramount among the responsibilities of a free press is the duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the people and sending them off to distant lands to die of foreign fevers and foreign shot and shell. ... [W]e are asked to hold that ... the Executive Branch, the Congress, and the Judiciary can make laws ... abridging freedom of the press in the name of 'national security.' ... To find that the President has 'inherent power' to halt the publication of news ... would wipe out the First Amendment and destroy the fundamental liberty and security of the very people the Government hopes to make 'secure.' ... The word 'security' is a broad, vague generality whose contours should not be invoked to abrogate the fundamental law embodied in the First Amendment. The guarding of military and diplomatic secrets at the expense of informed representative government provides no real security ... .  The Framers of the First Amendment, fully aware of both the need to defend a new nation and the abuses of the English and Colonial governments, sought to give this new society strength and security by providing that freedom of speech, press, religion, and assembly should not be abridged.<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=403&invol=713 ''New York Times Co. v. United States'', 403 U.S. at 714-20.]</ref> \n\nJustice [[William O. Douglas]] largely concurred with Black, arguing that the need for a free press as a check on government prevents any governmental restraint on the press.<ref>''New York Times Co. v. United States'', 403 U.S. at 720-24.</ref>\n\nJustice [[William J. Brennan|William J. Brennan, Jr.]], wrote separately to explain that the publication of the documents did not qualify as one of the three exceptions to the freedom of expression established in ''[[Near v. Minnesota]]'' (1931).<ref>''New York Times Co. v. United States'', 403 U.S. at 724-27.</ref>\n\nJustice [[Potter Stewart]] and Justice [[Byron R. White]] agreed that it is the responsibility of the Executive to ensure national security through the protection of its information. However, in areas of national defense and international affairs, the President of United States possesses great constitutional independence that is virtually unchecked by the Legislative and Judicial branch. \"In absence of governmental [[Separation of powers|checks and balances]]\", per Justice Stewart, \"the only effective restraint upon executive policy and power in [these two areas] may lie in an enlightened citizenry - in an informed and critical public opinion which alone can here protect the values of democratic government\".<ref>''New York Times Co. v. United States'', 403 U.S. at 727-30.</ref>\n\nJustice [[Thurgood Marshall]] argued that the term \"national security\" was too broad to legitimize prior restraint, and also argued that it is not the Court\u2019s job to create laws where the Congress had not spoken.<ref>''New York Times Co. v. United States'', 403 U.S. at 740-48.</ref>\n\n===Dissenting opinions===\n\nChief Justice [[Warren E. Burger]], dissenting, argued that \"the imperative of a free and unfettered press comes into collision with another imperative, the effective functioning of a complex modern government\", that there should be a detailed study on the effects of these actions. He argued that in the haste of the proceedings, and given the size of the documents, the Court was unable to gather enough information to make a decision. He also argued that the Times should have discussed the possible societal repercussions with the Government prior to publication of the material. The Chief Justice did not argue that the Government had met the aforementioned standard, but rather that the decision should not have been made so hastily.<ref>''New York Times Co. v. United States'', 403 U.S. at 748-52.</ref>\n\nJustice [[John Marshall Harlan II|John M. Harlan]] and Justice [[Harry A. Blackmun]] joined the Chief Justice in arguing the faults in the proceedings, and the lack of attention towards national security and the rights of the Executive.<ref>''New York Times Co. v. United States'', 403 U.S. at 752-63.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Government of the United States|Journalism|Freedom of speech}}\n*''[[New York Times Co. v.
