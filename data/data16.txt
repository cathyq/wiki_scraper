Tasini''''', [[Case citation#United States|533 U.S. 483]] (2001), is a leading decision by the [[United States Supreme Court]] on the issue of [[copyright]] in the contents of a [[newspaper]] [[database]]. It held that ''[[The New York Times]]'', in licensing back issues of the newspaper for inclusion in electronic databases such as [[LexisNexis]], could not license the works of [[free-lance]] [[journalists]] contained in the newspapers.\n\nThe lawsuit brought by members of the UAW's [[National Writers Union]] against the [[The New York Times Company|New York Times Company]], [[Newsday|Newsday Inc.]], [[Time Warner|Time Inc.]], [[University Microfilms International]], and [[LexisNexis]]. The freelance writers charged [[copyright infringement]] due to the use and reuse in electronic media of articles initially licensed to be published in print form. In a 7-2 ruling delivered by [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Justice Ginsburg]], the Court affirmed the [[copyright]] privileges of freelance writers whose works were originally published in [[periodicals]] and then provided by the [[publishers]] to electronic [[Bibliographic database|databases]] without explicit permission of, or compensation to, the [[writers]]. As a result of the decision, [[plaintiffs]] won a compensation pool of $18 million.\n\n==History==\nThe case was initially heard in the [[United States district court|district court]] of Judge [[Sonia Sotomayor]], who held that the publishers were within their rights according to the [[Copyright Act of 1976]].  This decision was reversed on appeal, and the Supreme Court affirmed the appellate court's reversal.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/26/sotomayor.resume/?iref=hpmostpop Sotomayor's resume, record on notable cases], ''CNN.com'', 26 May 2009.
